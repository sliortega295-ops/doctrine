title: Human Nature
description: "Human nature is neither inherently good, nor bad. Instead, we should consider the operating conditions, and the environment in which human beings exist, that influence their behavior to a great extent; thus, creating the current human condition."

What is the nature of a computer? - To compute information; which is nor good, nor bad.

## Like a Computer
Human nature is to take in information, process it, and output in the form of behavior. Human beings are not computers, however, much like a computer, human beings are programmable.

Similar to a computer, if a human has a bad "file-system format" (conditions during a child's formative ears), a bad “operating system” (culture / environment), and bad “software programs” (erroneous, rigid, and dogmatic beliefs), their “output” (behavior) onto the “screen” (life) will also be bad. Therefore, these people will contribute to deteriorating conditions on a mass scale, for themselves, and all other beings around them.

The behavior of any person will largely depend upon his or her programming; the quality of the information being taken in by them, which enables them to process and create efficiently.

- Garbage in ---> Garbage out
- Quality in ---> Quality out

## Knowledge
(Or lack thereof): Available information - This constitutes potential knowledge that may be generated,
processed, understood, and acted upon by individuals.

## Understanding
(Or lack thereof): Decision-making process - These processes take place in the mind and are chosen by each
individual based upon available information.

## Wisdom
(Or lack thereof): Human behavior - Each individual's behavior is based upon the quality of their decision-
making processes. Which are based upon the quality of their available information.

::note
Wisdom is not the same as knowledge or understanding.
::

Wisdom is either action, or inaction, always. It is knowledge and understanding which has
been applied. For example, knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit
salad.

## Generated Result
(Order or chaos): Manifested reality - The quality of the condition which manifests in any society is based upon the aggregate quality of human behavior within that society.

so, let's look at this debate that's been going on since time immemorial, of human nature
versus human nurture. And again, I'm getting ready to piss everybody off.

This debate’s been going on forever, which is it? What’s human nature really look like? What's its essence? Is it angelic or demonic? I would say it's neither, it's neither one of these things. It's not both- it's neither. So nobody wins here for who falls on one side or the other. And it's a very difficult thing for people to accept as well, because when we ask the question, “what is the nature of a human being?” It's a very similar question to asking “What is the nature of this computer up on this platform? what is the nature of that projector? What is the nature of those cameras?” Well, can I actually say what the nature of these things is? It's a computer; its nature is to compute information. What is the nature of that projector? Is it good? Is it bad? Is it angelic? Is it demonic? “Is that projector demonic?” No! Its nature is that it projects imagery. what is the nature of these cameras? They capture imagery, that's all. So, what’s the nature of a human being?

The nature of a human being is that it takes in information, it processes it, and then it outputs it through behavior. And as we're going to see, that's very much like a computer; I'm not saying that it is a computer, I'm saying that it's like one. So, human nature is neither inherently good nor inherently evil, as many people think, fall on one side of this argument or the other. Instead, we should consider the operating conditions or the environment in which human beings exist, which influences behavior, to a great extent, thus creating the current human condition. That's why it's called the human
condition; it's not called the situation we're in; it's called the human condition. It's not called the human nature, okay? It's called the human condition. There's a reason it's called a condition, for any condition to be in place, well hey, what condition is my computer in right now? What condition is my projector in? What condition are richard’s cameras in? They're in operating conditions; they're doing what they're supposed to be doing because they've been kept up in good condition. In the example of my computer, it has a working operating system without malware on it. It has software that does the job, that does what I'm asking it to do properly, without bugs. Those are the conditions; the operating conditions will determine “how does it perform?” What kind of output can it put out into the world?

Again what I'm saying here is that human beings are like computers, not that they are computers. Let me just state that emphatically, we're not computers, we're like computers. We are programmable; that's the nature of a human being. How many people have ever heard anybody say that the nature of a human being is that a human being is programmable? To my knowledge, I'm the only person or researcher that is calling that human nature. Our nature is that we can be programmed. And that's another thing people don't want to hear; they don't want to hear this, because again they liken it to a mechanized machine, and again to emphasize, I'm not saying we are computers, I'm saying we're like them in the ways we can be programmed. So, what gets put into a person, through the environment, which is called the culture, and becomes their programming, determines what they will output onto the screen, which is called human life. And that will create the human condition in the aggregate, as more and more people operate that way.

Alright so let's take a look at how this works. Human beings are programmable much like computers. Like a computer, if a human being has a bad file system format; that's the first thing you're gonna do when you get ready to use a computer, you have to format the drive. How many people here are somewhat techy? not many, okay, about a quarter to a third. So, some people will know what I'm talking about here, for the others, excuse the jargon for a moment. I'll explain what it is; a file system format is; you've got to format the hard drive so you can prepare it for a specific operating system, which is basically the task controllers. It's gonna control what happens on the computer, how programs get launched, how memory is used, et cetera in a nutshell. I do this for a living, so I know all the technical stuff, so I'll try to keep it simple.

if the human being has a bad file system format, this is akin to the operating conditions during a child's formative years, the first 6 years of their life essentially. Now, think about it, we call this their formative years, their format-ive years, like a format on a hard drive because this is what puts the file system into the human being. That prepares it for its operating system. So, largely, what programs the child at this stage is the parents, and what they will see in their immediate environment and home and during their very early years in “schooling.” now, like a computer, if a human being also has a bad operating system, this is like MacOS, Windows, Linux, et cetera, android, iOS, these are operating systems. Again, they are basically providing a platform that other programs will run in, and they're providing a graphical user interface. This is your culture; the operating system is the culture in which the programs run. So, let's say, if you already have a bad operating system, meaning you're already surrounded in a bad environment, in a bad culture, that's also going to negatively impact the output. And then they have bad software programs; now these are the programs that you run, if I didn't have a good presentation software, my presentation might come out sloppy, it might crash in the middle of it, it might not display the graphics or the text properly. So you gotta make sure you're working with good reliable software as well.

now what the software is, is the belief systems. What the person has taken into the mind and has processed and made part of themself.
and now, if all of those things are bad, we have 3 bad components: the format is bad, the file system format, which is the formative years of the child, the culture is bad, meaning already growing up in a bad culture or in a culture that condones moral relativism et cetera and doesn't understand Natural Law, and the software programs that have been input into the child are bad, meaning their belief systems.

what do you think the output of that “computer” is going to be like? Is it going to be good? Is it going to be chaotic? If I screw up my systems hard drive format, if I put an operating system at like alpha state and it's not ready for prime time because the development is not finished, it's half-baked. And then I load up on crappy software that's full of bugs, and the developers didn't really care about programming them correctly. Do you think that computer is gonna operate properly and give me the output on that screen that I'm looking for, or output on the printout that I'm looking for, or output on the internet that I'm looking for? Good luck. If you know a little bit about computers, you're laughing now because it'd be ridiculous to assume that it could do that. Well, why do we think that we're gonna have that in our environment when all of these things are badly programmed? See, the output onto the screen is also going to be horrible, if all those 3 things that determine how the system works are also bad. So, it will continue; it will contribute to deteriorating conditions on a mass scale. Like a computer, the behavior of a human being largely depends upon its programming, and its programming is the quality of the information that is being inputted into it. The quality of the information it's taking in. The quality of the information it's taking in is going to determine the quality of the information that it's outputting like any other computer.

So, if garbage goes in, surprise, garbage is going to come out. If good information goes in, quality goes in, quality will come out, and the output will be as one wants it to be. It will be able to process and create efficiently, effectively, not chaotically.

Here's a very simple diagram, again, if people understand it, they really get how Natural Law functions. And again, it's very unpopular, people don't want to look at what the bottom base, foundation or platform of this structure is. Because once again, this idea that knowledge is what's required makes many people upset because they want to believe they're gonna achieve these things they say they want without doing the work to acquire that knowledge. And therefore, understand the requirements for obtaining those conditions.

so, we start with available information, and when people look at what I'm going to describe here, they will recognize it as something, and I'll hold what that is for a moment. available information is what you're starting with. This constitutes potential knowledge, and it can become knowledge if it's taken in if it's amassed if it's aggregated. It can be gathered, it can be processed, it can be understood, and then it can be acted upon. You could call this the grammar stage, of this 3-part process I'm going to explain. You could also refer to this as the input stage if we're looking at it in a computer model; this is the stage of inputting information or programming something.

Now the next step that’s built upon this, is once you've taken information in, necessary information, you then come to a position of understanding it; you know what it means, you recognize the patterns. So, this is the second step in this process. now, in the first stage your knowledge or lack of knowledge is going to lead to understanding or lack of understanding. If you have understanding present, your decision-making processes are going to be in harmony with what you say you want. you're gonna understand “if here's what I want, this is what's necessary to get that, to make that happen, to manifest it.” That's understanding. It's a decision-making process that happens within the mind. These processes take place in the human mind and are chosen by each individual based upon available information. So again you can see, if information is held back, if it is occulted, or even if it’s just people are dissuaded from taking it in, because people will say “no there's nothing there, there's nothing to it,” you can see how they'll never get to this step. They'll never understand, they'll never get to the second level of creating our reality effectively and efficiently.

The 3rd stage to this process is what you do with what you have come to understand, to know and understand. So, this is the action stage. Each individual's behavior, the behaviors that they choose through their own free will, is based upon the quality of their decision-making processes that are happening within the human mind. that process, as we have already seen, is in return, based upon the quality of available information. So this is behavior. People don't think of wisdom as behavior. They don't think of wisdom as action. They think of it as something that you just know. No. wrong. Wisdom is not knowledge or understanding, wisdom is action! Let me say this again, wisdom is action! It is knowledge and understanding that has been applied. application. That's the program that you're going to run, on the computer that you've put an operating system on and formatted properly. The application is the action. When you're working in a computer doing things, you're working in an application. You're not building the things you're building with the operating system. The operating system is what's supporting the program that allows you to be creative. And in return, the file format supports the operating system.

we start with available information which can be converted into knowledge, which can then, through decision-making processes and filtering of that information to eliminate inconsistencies, can lead to an understanding. In continuation, the understanding can then lead through our free will decision-making processes, to be converted into behavior, into action in the world. When it's done properly, it's wisdom. When it's done with morality and ethics in mind, it's wisdom. When it's done without that, it's folly, and it leads to more and more chaos.

So, based upon these 3 processes, something is generated, something is created in the physical manifestation: physically manifested reality, the real world, so-to- speak. The manifested reality is based upon the aggregate behavior. Aggregate behavior. no one person is creating the reality we are experiencing, it’s another fallacy of the new age movement and thinking. In the aggregate, we are creating our shared reality. All of the behaviors put together, creates the output on the screen or the generated result. Is it orderly? Is it chaotic? Well, that's going to be based upon whether someone took in the information, processed it efficiently to come to an understanding, and then acted upon it. the manifested reality is the quality of the condition which manifests in any given society based upon the aggregate quality of human behavior within that society. This is how our reality is actually created. The conditions that we experience as the daily events of our life. It's a simple 3 stage process that leads to a result.

and for many people here, you will recognize if you've looked into this discovery process and this creative process, is known as the Trivium. This is what the Trivium is. in the ancient traditions, this is what the Trivium was labelled; it was labelled: knowledge, understanding and wisdom. In the later aspects, when they passed out of mystery school tradition hands and went into some other think-tank and society hands, the knowledge of the Trivium was termed: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Grammar being the knowledge stage of aggregating available information, logic being the understanding stage of using processes to analyze and filter said information and come to an understanding of it. And then the rhetoric stage was the application, the action, taking action based on what you've come to understand. Now, there’s a third way of looking at the Trivium in computer jargon, and that is: input, processing and output. And then you get the result on the screen, which is called life. Any way you want to look at the trivium, I don't care, but understand it and know how it works, because this is a big part of why we're in the situation that we're in, is that the Trivium methodology of truth discovery has been completely obliterated from public consciousness. 

Completely obliterated. And I ask people “how many people have even ever heard the word trivium?” Raise your hand if you've heard the word. So a good portion of the people here have. Many people have never heard the word, and if you do a google search on it, most people are gonna get back the band, the metal band, The Trivium. Which is not a bad band, but the whole point here is, the results that are gonna come back through google or bing or yahoo or whatever are going to give you a metal band, a heavy metal band, instead of the Trivium method of learning; the classical liberal arts education methodology, because they want to try to sanitize that as much from human consumption as possible. They don't even want you to understand how that works at all. And that's why it's been removed from public schooling. And that's why as long as this society stays the way it is, it'll never be put back into the public schooling.

i tell people a little anecdote; when I was in high school, and thank god I went to the high school I did because they really hammered Latin and Greek into you. You were gonna know your Latin and Greek when you came out of my high school. For whatever other indoctrination they put into you, that's another story. But, I tell you what, you came out of there knowing your ancient languages, it was still part of the curriculum when I was in high school, and again, I think I came out better out of there because of simply the linguistics knowledge that I gained from it. We read Gaius Julius Caesar’s war journals in their original Latin and translated them, and in one of them he's talking about, he's absolutely lambasting one of his centurions. They're on a campaign in Gaul, which is france now, and Caesar is making his rounds with his troops and getting ready to push deeper into Gaul. When they would have their encampments, they would have a lot of slaves of the Roman Empire that they would take with them on their campaign that would do a lot of lifting of the equipment and carrying of the equipment of the centurions to do battle in the next battlefield location. And the slaves would have to do all that manual labor. Caesar says to one of his centurions, he's passing by their encampment and he sees one of the actual centurion leaders teaching one of the slaves the Trivium method, and he flips out on him. In this journal, he says; “I caught one of my centurions teaching the trivium” and freaks out on him, “how dare you teach a slave our method of learning, soon they won't want to be a slave anymore. There would be an uprising if they knew, if they knew our truth discovery methodology. I forget how it really ended, but I think how it ended was; he told this centurion, “if I ever catch you doing this again, I will personally cast you into the wilderness of Gaul and let the Gaulians deal with you,” who knew that the Roman Empire was trying to conquer their people at that point. Which is basically saying: it would be a death sentence, but I won't even carry it out, I'll let our enemy carry it out on you. That's how much they didn't want their slaves to understand their methodology for learning, and that's the Trivium. And that's why most people have never heard the word. So, you gotta to look into it and understand how it works, that's all I can say about it. It is how we build our reality; either efficiently or destructively.
