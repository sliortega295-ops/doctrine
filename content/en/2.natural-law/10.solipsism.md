## Etymology

The word **_Solipsism_** is derived from the Latin adjective **_Solus_** which means "Alone", or "Only"
and the Latin pronoun **_Ipse_** which means "Self", or "Myself" - "Only myself", or "the Self alone".

## Ideology
The ideology of a solipsist is: "Nothing exists outside of me, I am the only being that exists in creation, and everything I perceive is created by me". Or in other words, "I am God". They believe that their perception is the only real perception, and that nobody else outside themselves truly even exists.

What this guide teaches, is that your perception isn't always truth. You have to work to align your perceptions with the truth. Hearing this can already be damaging enough to the ego for some people. But what a solipsist believes is that you don't even exist, and your existence is fully based on his or her perception. Therefore, in their mind, so are your perceptions.

## The Third Sin
Solipsism also happens to be the third sin of Satanism, meaning that Satanists don't want any
Solipsism within their own community of followers, but they think it's fine for others to live according to this ideology. The first sin of Satanism happens to be stupidity, which is also something that is looked down upon within their community, but considered fine for others.


## Comfortable Ignorance
In short, Solipsism is the ideology that only one's own mind is sure to exist. Solipsists contend that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. Therefore, to them, there is no such thing as objective truth, and nothing about the external world and its workings can actually truly be known.

::note
This state of mind only ensures a person to feel comfortable in their ignorance and laziness.

This woman also told me that she is a “follower” of the new age ideology that is referred to as ‘the course in miracles.' How many people have even heard of this? A lot of people. You know what that is? It's called Solipsism wrapped in a nice neat new package. Solipsism, how many people are familiar with the ideology called Solipsism? good, more than I would've thought. Most people have never heard of this. Solipsism is a completely egoic and destructive ideology that has absolutely no bearing or resemblance to truth in any way. And the people who are solipsists are mentally ill. I'm not even gonna provide any evidence of that, I'm telling you, you need to research this religion and sickness for yourself. It's a mental illness. A solipsist is a mentally ill person who should probably be somehow removed/segregated from society and institutionalized until they are made well because they are a destructive influence on
society.

This is what I focused on, on podcast number one of my podcast series and radio shows. i went into the ideology of what Solipsism is and how destructive it is and how it's a religion. First of all let's look at the word, and you'll notice I'll be breaking down words all day long because if you don't understand where words came from, you don't really understand what they really were intended to mean, regardless of whatever connotation they may have taken on in the modern world. The intended meaning of the word, the original meaning is derived from its etymological derivation. You need to go into the ancient languages: Latin and Greek roots and other languages: Germanic, Arabic, et cetera, and you need to break down the words from their etymological origins, then you will understand their real meaning. And I'm telling you, you do this, and the top of your head will blow off by what you will find, by what words we speak on a daily basis actually mean and we have no idea what they mean. So, the word Solipsism comes from the Latin adjective solus , which means alone or one, and then the Latin pronoun ipse, which means self, myself, etc.

The ideology of Solipsism is that nothing exists outside of me; I'm the only being that exists in creation. Essentially it's another way of saying I'm god; that my perception is the only real perception and no one else is here. Now imagine that. Now what I'm essentially telling the audience here today is, your perceptions are not the truth. You have to work to align your perception with the truth. That's damaging enough to the human ego. If I just said “none of you exist, I'm only perceiving your existence, I'm the only one who exists.” Imagine how egoic that statement is and actually how demoralizing it is to other people; you're even telling them I don't even consider you exist. That's what a solipsist is. They believe the universe is a big illusion created somehow for their amusement and that there's no objective reality that you don't exist, you don't exist, you don't exist; I'm the only one who exists. That not a mental illness- we don't diagnose that as mental illness. I don't care if you want to accept the notion that everything is one, I personally accept that notion, I do accept that we are all one. That doesn't mean you're not existent in the physical domain right now as I'm talking to you. of course we all exist here, we are in the physical domain. The whole point is, these people want to believe the entire physical domain is such a illusion, that nothing that takes place in it matters or has any significance and should be watched and nothing should be done to change it.

let me explain what this is folks: when I was a satanist and I was working inside the church of satan and other dark occult organizations. They have a set of sins, believe it or not. They don't look at them as sins in the same way like religionists look at sin. They have sins where these are behaviors and thought patterns that should not be engaged in by the Dark Occultist themselves, by the magician if you will; you are not to engage in these behaviors, but we are to peddle them to other people. We are to get them to engage in these behaviors. You know what the first one is? (Audience response) no it's not, that's the second or third, I think it's the third if I'm not mistaken, I don't have the list handy, but the first one is stupidity. That's the first satanic sin for the Dark Occultist. But they want other people in deep stupidity. They want other people in deep ignorance. The idea here is: we will know it all, we will know the truth, so that we can control others and keep them a dumbed down herd. There's a bunch of other ones but I think the second or third is Solipsism.

Solipsism is one of the biggest sins for satanists and Dark Luciferians, and Dark Occultists. they don't want any of their membership believing in this mental illness nonsense, but they want to propagate it and peddle it. They want to do that and they told me personally, higher ups in this network told me personally when I was working with them, “wait until you see the new age books that we, our membership will be writing or either writing ourself or putting into the hands of useful dupes to write and put out there. We'll be giving them the idea and they'll write it for us and put it out there as their own idea.” and they said “we are going to propagate and peddle Solipsism like you have never seen.” And you know what, when they say something, they do it. I'm serious. Their act is together, they act on the same page and for that I have respect for them as an enemy. and I don't take anything they do lightly. I recognize they have the will, they're not like the rest of humanity. They align their thoughts, their knowledge with their version of care. It's not like our emotionally based care, but they care about what they're doing, and then they act. And when they act, they act in concert and they get it done. I'm not saying i agree with any of their agenda because I don't and I'm trying to stop it. But I have respect for their unity. They are unified and on the same page and humanity is not. that's why, in all honesty, we're having our rear ends handed to us in this spiritual battle right now, at least right now.
Solipsism is the ideology that only one's mind is sure to exist. Solipsists contend that knowledge of anything outside of one's own mind is unsure and hence there is no such thing as objective truth. No such thing as objective truth, and therefore nothing about the external world and its workings can actually ever be known. Just think about that statement: it's saying no one can ever know anything, you cannot come to know anything at all, there is no such thing as knowledge. So what I would say to somebody who's following the “course in miracles,” or course in Solipsism, or course in acceptance of all forms of evil in this world, is: you can't know anything by reading the course in miracles because nothing can be known. Why would a solipsist ever pick up a book, why would a solipsist ever watch anything, any video? Why would a solipsist ever engage in a conversation with another human being? Tell a solipsist “you can't know that you're going to fall off that cliff, so why don't you go try to walk over it and see what happens because you can't be sure of anything. They won't do that though.

The whole point here is, this is a religion, this is a new age religion and I'm telling you who it's peddled by. It's peddled by the occultists who have the knowledge of how natural Law works and are trying to put out whatever destructive ideologies they can to get people to not understand it. Or to even go so far as to believe that nothing can be understood. Why would you bother looking into Natural Law, nothing can be known? it's unbelievable that anybody would be so gullible and naïve to fall into this mindset. let me just tell you what it really is; it's a person who has given up on life. They feel that it's so difficult to know anything and they don't want to do the work to come to that level of knowledge, that they just said, “I don't believe it can be known. That makes me
feel more comfortable in my ignorance and laziness.” That's the truth about what Solipsism is and that's the truth about my friend I bumped into at the MUFON (Mutual uFO Network) conference and I'd say that to her face. So, we have to realize we're battling this force and this religion is on the rise; Solipsism is on the rise. More people are becoming solipsists or solipsistic in their beliefs, in their thought processes.
