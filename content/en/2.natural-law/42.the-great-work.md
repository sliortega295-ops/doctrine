title: The Great Work
description: The Great Work can only be performed after one has already realized the truth regarding Natural Law, and brought oneself (one's own actions) into alignment with it.

## Internal Alignment
From that moment on, the teaching of the Great Work can begin; because once that has been done, there is no more internal contradiction or opposition within that person. From there on out, you can legitimately start teaching it to other people because you know it deeply enough, and have truly aligned your behavior to it. The Great Work is what comes next.

::note
The Great Work is the arduous task of influencing other people to go through that same process of positive change, that you have gone through yourself.
::

It is to help them realize that in supporting and condoning the legitimacy of "authority" and "government (man's law)," they have actually been supporting and condoning the legitimacy of slavery. And that they were immoral for having done so; convincing a person of that is hard work. Because people usually don't want to hear this, they want what they think is true, to be true.

What the Great Work comes down to is to get people to abandon their (false) religions The false and dogmatic beliefs which hold back the progress of consciousness by impeding the reception of knowledge of Natural Law.</span>

>"One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable, and therefore, not popular."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Carl Gustav Jung, Swiss psychotherapist</i>


The true Great Work is to become a teacher of Natural Law; and as the old saying goes 'many hands make light work.'

>"Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. That is the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the U.S.A.</i>

>"In every declining civilization there is a small remnant of people who adhere to the right against the wrong; who recognize the difference between good and evil and who will take an active stand for the former and against the latter; who can still think and discern, and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual decay of their day." - excerpt from the book 'Toward a New World Order' by
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Donald S. McAlvany, Author, "Toward a New World Order"</i>

The words that are attributed to Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Matthew:

>"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the Earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man's enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Jesus Christ, (Matthew 10:34-39)</i>

If you imagine that these words were in some way "spoken" by the truth instead of Jesus Christ. It's telling you that there will be people in your own family who will not align themselves with right over wrong behavior, they will continue to choose, and to advocate violence and slavery. These are not people you want to continue to align yourself with, if you have truly made an effort to explain what is really taking place.

<!-- "Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God (Creator of the universe); believe also in me (Truth). My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know
my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." -->

<!-- Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." -->

<!-- Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who
has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."
- excerpt from the Bible (John 14:1-14) -->

## What will this battle really be against?

The personal "battle" that must take place will be against the inner demons which exist within the psyche of humankind, namely:

- Egos hardened into "negative knowledge"
- Emotional mind control
- Fear of true freedom

## "Negative Knowledge"

The greatest enemy may not be ignorance, but rather the illusion of knowledge. When a person dismisses information simply because they think they already know it, or think it isn't important. Not only are they not at the starting point for truth discovery; because they are already attached to information
that isn't true. They are put in a negative starting position because they must first unlearn the information they have been conditioned to believe, to even get to the actual starting point. This happens when a person is in left-brain imbalance.

## Emotional Mind Control

"If it's unpleasant, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to see it, and I certainly don't want to tell others about it! I'll just ignore it, and it will go away." What happens when you would do that with, for example, an illness, or any other problem? It doesn't tend to get better, it only gets worse.

Another form of emotional mind control is when a person dismisses information solely because that person dislikes the way the information is being presented, or delivered to them. You cannot determine the veracity of informational content based on how it makes you feel, doing so is a logical fallacy; you cannot "think" with the emotions. While emotions are also extremely important (our "compass" for morality), you can't thoroughly analyze and conclude what's true based only on how something makes you feel. If you are told a lie in a sweet, pleasant and soothing voice, it's still a lie. If you are told a truth in an abrasive, harsh and scratchy voice, it is still truth.

>"Truth is belligerent. Truth is, by its very nature, at war with the forces of falsehood and deceit."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Bertolt Brecht, German Poet</i>

## Fear of True Freedom

The fear of true freedom come from self-loathing due to lack of self-respect (heart of the problem) and from the refusal to own personal responsibility (symptom of the problem).

People that are psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually immature, people who haven't grown up and young children are the kind of people who want to live in perpetual refusal to their personal responsibility (something that is regarded a hallmark of true adulthood and maturity), because they have nested traumatic issues that have led to self-loathing and lack of self-respect.

Until we start to figure out the causal factors of the other manifesting psychological conditions listed above, we are merely dealing with the symptoms, not the root of the problem. If a child doesn't like itself, and they feel they are "not good enough" or "not worthy," all these imagined feelings of inadequacy, and self-loathing. Those are usually the factors that cause their refusal to grow up, and their refusal to take personal responsibility for their actions during adulthood.

::note
Abandonment is the specific type of childhood trauma they have gone through and the root of the fear of true freedom.
::

description: The human species is suffering from very deep-seated parental abandonment issues, that lie at the very core of our global psychological condition; the human condition. Until we deal with that deeply nested psychological trauma, we aren't dealing with the actual root cause of the problem, and we won't get any closer to solving it.</span>

## Requirements

**What will be required on the part of those performing the Great Work?**

- Knowledge of the real enemy
- Service to truth
- Courage and persistence
- Practical real-world skills

## Knowledge of The Real Enemy

The real enemy is the ignorant masses. There are people that say: "The Illuminati enslaves humanity." Which is not at all the case; humanity enslaves the real Illuminati (the 'Illuminated (enlightened)' ones). If that term is to be used for anyone, it makes more sense to apply it to actual teachers of Natural Law, the people that know and understand what is written about in this guide are the real "Illuminati." - They are the real "enlightened" ones; the ones with the light, the ones with the knowledge of Natural Law.

::note
Humanity is enslaving itself, and also the true Illuminati: the teachers that are actually living under the conditions of slavery because they are here with the ignorant masses.
::

It almost seems as if people prefer to think: "we're powerless victims, there is no choice involved here, this is something that is just being done to us." While free will is always in existence, and it's a matter of changing one's thoughts, and therefore changing one's choices. And that is our own personal responsibility which can never be given away. Once more, **you are always responsible for your own actions.**

## Service to Truth
Truth can never be destroyed. But humanity can definitely be destroyed, if we refuse to act in service to truth as its defenders. There are people that think truth doesn't need to be defended, which is simply not true. Truth needs to be fended for at all times and places, because the attack on it is never-ending and non-
stop. If we do not come to defend truth; the voice of untruth and deception rules the day, and the voice of truth will not be heard. Since the truth doesn't have its own voice in our physical domain, we must act as its mediums and literally be its voice, if we desire true freedom.

It is definitely possible for us to co-create a positive outcome, but this can only be accomplished if we care enough to learn the truth ourselves, and then develop the courage to speak it to other people.

>"If you love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget you were our countrymen."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Samuel Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the U.S.A.</i>

## Persistence
We are the vehicles by which truth operates in our world. Therefore, it is our shared responsibility at this time to help to awaken others by continuously speaking the truth, even if we feel burdened by this task, even if we feel that nobody is listening, and even if it makes all people involved feel uncomfortable.

Nobody ever said that the truth is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside; the truth can be horrible, and yet, it needs to be embraced as a lover.

>"There are only two mistakes one can ever make on the path to truth; not starting, and not going all the way."
<i class="text-sm pt-4 block ">Buddha, Religious leader.</i>


Lastly, we need practical real-world skills. The end goal isn't to have you just knowing this information for yourself; but to communicate this information to the masses. And to be able to communicate truth to others properly, knowledge and certain skills are required.

Technology is something that improves life for us, and makes life easier for us. In this technological era we live in, it is absolutely crucial that we learn to use this technology as our tools for communication of truth.

**Some examples of those practical skills are:**

- **Organization:** Whether it be a seminar, a meeting, or any other coming together of people.
- **Communication:** Good vocabulary, and choice of words; to communicate concepts clearly.
- **Graphic design:** For making power-point presentations, flyers, websites etc.
- **Presentation:** Whether in front of a group of friends, or an audience full of strangers.
- **Audio:** For making podcasts, or any other form of broadcasting audio.
- **Video:** For making compilations, vlogs, or any other form of video presentation.
- **Website** development: To accumulate your findings and make them accessible to the world.
- **Networking:** Can also be called 'people skills,' referring to direct communication.
- **Marketing & promotion:** To let others know where to find this information.

If most of us do not have these skills, we won't be reaching the optimum number of people. We have to become the new media, that is dedicated to truth, and put it out there for other people's edification.

## Moral Obligation
When we deeply understand knowledge as important as this, we almost have a moral obligation to share it with others; what gives us the right to keep it to ourselves? If it can greatly improve our own lives, and the lives of those around us.

## Outlet
If you keep taking in more and more knowledge, you're building up more and more pressure within yourself. If you don't have an outlet valve for that pressure, you become "Niagara Falls inside a water balloon," one day, it's going to burst.

## Transcript

### Part 244
So what is the True Great Work? The True Great Work can only be performed after one has already realized the Truth regarding Natural Law and brought oneself, one’s own actions into alignment with Natural Law. That’s when it begins because once you do that and you’re no longer in that internal contradiction or
opposition, that’s when you can legitimately start teaching it to other people because you know it deeply enough and you’ve actually aligned your behavior to it.


### Part 245
The True Great Work is what comes after that. And here’s what it is, this is actually what the True Great Work is now. It is the arduous task of influencing other people to go through the very same process of change, of positive change in consciousness that you have gone through. It is to help them to realize that in supporting and condoning the legitimacy of “authority” and government, in other words “man’s law,” that what they have actually been supporting and condoning is the legitimacy of slavery, and that they were immoral for having done so. Now that is hard work because people don’t want to hear this. They want to believe what they want to believe; they want to be true what they want to be true. They filter their perceptions through those lenses.


### Part 246
In short, what the True Great Work comes down to is to actually get people to abandon their religions- their false religions I really should make this slide say. The false and dogmatic beliefs which hold back the progress of consciousness by impeding the reception of Truth and Natural Law. Their calcified religious belief systems, that’s what has to be broken down and abandoned.


### Part 247
Carl Jung described the Great Work beautifully. I consider him a modern day alchemist, as I consider many other teachers of the Great Work. He said “one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.” Making the darkness conscious, not wishing for it to become conscious, not meditating upon it, by making it happen through an act of will. And that can only be done if enough people are doing the Great Work. This latter procedure that he’s just described he says “however, is disagreeable, and therefore, not popular.” So few people are doing this work. The answer is to actually become the teacher. I don’t do this because I want a lot of people to be students and follow what I’m saying, I could care less whether you want to follow me. Believe me, I’m telling you the wrong thing to do would be to follow me. That’s a bad example. You follow me, you’re going to go down a deep path of suffering for many many years before you come out of it. It would be a bad choice. I’m telling you to follow Truth, to know Truth. Has nothing to do with me. when people hear that’s what the great work is, to help change other peoples’ minds, once you change your own, it’s like this: let me run away from that as fast as possible.
“Are you crazy, you want me to do what? That’s the hardest thing there is to do.” exactly, that’s why so few people are doing it.


### Part 248
Many hands make light work. If we had more people involved in the effort it might go smoother, it might go faster. Jefferson said: “educate and inform the whole mass of people. That is the only sure reliance for the preservation of our Liberty.” education is the answer.


### Part 249
Researcher Donald McAlvany said in his book ‘Toward A New World order:’ “in every declining civilization there is a small remnant of people who adhere to the Right against the Wrong; who recognize the difference between Good and Evil and
who will take an active stand for the former and against the latter. There’s a small group who can still think and discern for themselves and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual decay of their day.” Brilliant.


### Part 250
The words that are attributed to Jesus in the gospel of Mathew and many people will never have heard this quote. He says, “do not suppose that I have come to bring Peace to the Earth. I did not come to bring Peace, but a Sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household- we’re gonna talk about who the enemy really is. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” These are words attributed by Jesus, but what you want to put in place of Jesus is the words Truth. The way. The Truth. The Light. Knowledge: Knowledge of Natural Law. christ Consciousness. He’s telling you, there are gonna be people in your own family that aren’t going to align themselves with Right over Wrong. They’re going to continue to choose slavery. They’re going to continue to advocate slavery. These aren’t people who you want to continue to align yourself with if you have made an effort to truly explain what’s really taking place.
see this is the concept of true forgiveness and turning the other cheek; it doesn’t mean turn the other cheek and continue to ignore evil and excuse evil indefinitely while it destroys you. It means you have to give people who you’re close with and you have an affinity with, more chances than you would give just somebody who you don’t know, to learn the truth. It’s like saying; “because I really care about this person personally, I’m going to keep going back, keep going back, keep going back, and I’m going to keep hitting them with the truth. And eventually if they come over to the side of Truth and right, fine, but what he’s saying here, is eventually this spiritual war is going to go hot so-to-speak, and the people even who are closest to us, if they don’t align themselves with Right are the people who are ultimately continuing the evil in the world. They’re the real spiritual enemy


### Part 251
What will this battle really be against, this spiritual war? Well I say it will really actually be against inner demons that exist in the psyche of mankind. And these inner demons are egos that are hardened into what I’ve referred to as “negative knowledge,” Emotional Mind Control, and the Fear of True Freedom.


### Part 252
So, negative knowledge is the concept that somebody already knows. They don’t want to look at something because “hey, I already know what’s really going on.” it’s the illusion of knowledge. The greatest enemy may not be ignorance, but rather the illusion of actual knowledge, and people don’t have the truth. Not only do they not have the truth but they’re at the zero point there because they haven’t really started looking into truth for themselves, but they’re attached to all this stuff that isn’t true, so that puts them in the negative. They got to do work to get back to zero of knowing nothing. that’s why I call it negative knowledge. You got to do hard work to get back to a clean
slate to start taking in some good stuff. Many people are in that state and the people who are in that state largely are the overly intellectual, the super left brained, the left-brain- prison folks.


### Part 253
Emotional Mind Control is the second inner demon. I encounter this all the time through people with my work because many people don’t have the thick skin to listen to somebody like me, and that’s okay, that’s alright. Again, what Art talked about is that in the ancient traditions, they talked about reserve the meat for the strong men and furnish the milk for the babies. I’m not here to convert the babies. I don’t have the patience for that. I don’t have the energy for that. What I’m trying to do is get the other teachers ready who might have the energy and patience for that because that’s not me and i’m being 100% perfectly honest with you that that’s not me. I’m not here to do that. i’m hoping to bring some other people that are most of the way there all the way there, so they can start doing that on a wider scale. They’re going to be the people who are going to work with people like that, not me. And I’m just being honest with you about it.
emotional mind control comes in a couple of forms; the new age variant is this right here:
“if it’s unpleasant, I don’t want to hear it, I don’t want to see it, and I certainly don’t want to tell others about it.” See no evil hear no evil speak no evil. I’ll just ignore it and it’ll go away on its own. Well what happens when you do that with any kind of a sickness or problem? Does it get better? It get’s worse.


### Part 254
The second form of emotional mind control is people have a problem hearing truth because they don’t like or prefer the way it’s delivered. I’m not going to stop delivering truth the way I deliver. This is my style. I like my style personally. I don’t think I have a problem at all in the way I present. I listen back to my presentations and I don’t totally pat myself on the back, but I say I did a damn good job there, and I’m proud of how I did personally. I’m making an honest assessment about how I present. and again, I realize my presentation style is mostly for the thick skinned, it’s not for the people with super delicate sensibilities, so be it. That’s not really who I’m trying to reach. I’m trying to do vertical integration, not horizontal integration; build up the community of people who really get it and they can start propagating it to the masses.
this concept is about the attractive newscaster on the nightly news; she can whisper sweet nothings in your ear all night with the blue frequencies behind her, you know, and say 2+2=5. (In a soft voice) 2+2=5, and she’s going to get a lot of people to believe that nonsense, but the person who’s actually telling you the truth that you might not like the sound of his voice, you might not like the harshness that he comes to you with the truth with; he might be screaming through a bull horn and saying “hey, you’re in danger, you are actively in danger.” There is an imperative here. There is a time consideration here; you don’t have all the time in the world to correct this. People say; “well I don’t like the way he said that. That comes off as negative to me. I think he’s fear mongering or making it a bigger deal about this than it is.” They’re not interested in the content, the actual information. They’re saying, “the way that was said offended me, I don’t prefer the sound of his voice or the tone he just took.” Well does that have any damn thing to do with whether the information was true or not? The people who are in this mind-state
are under emotional mind control. They believe you can determine the voracity of informational content based upon how it makes you feel, and this is a logical fallacy. that cannot be done. You cannot think with the emotions, and I’m not telling you to disregard the emotions; they’re unbelievably important, they are our compass for morality in our lives, they’re the compass through which we should set direction of our behavior. But you can’t come to determine, analyze, and break down what’s true or not and make a filtering system based on just how the information made you feel when you heard it.
you have to actually think with the mind, with both hemispheres of the brain, with true intelligence to come to filter and determine what’s true. No matter how much anybody wants to give you that soft sweet pleasant emotional voice, that person’s still lying to you and no matter how much the person who comes with an abrasive harsh nasty or scratchy
voice might keep telling you 2+2=4 and you don’t personally like their tone, guess what folks, it still equals 4 at all times and places. That’s the truth. No amount of pleasantry where wrapping up the lie is ever going to make the statement on the left here (2+2=5) true, ever. But yet, that’s what people would rather prefer to hear if it’s told to them in a nice pleasant tone.


### Part 255
Truth is belligerent as I said in the beginning of the presentation. It is, by its
very nature, at war with the forces of falsehood and deceit. Correct.


### Part 256
“We literally believe that we are in the Right to ignore a message of Truth if the messenger is somehow distasteful to us. I would argue this to be a symptom of total madness.” That’s an anonymous quote I also found on the forum and that’s a great piece wisdom. That’s a gem of wisdom right there. It is total madness to disregard truth just because we don’t like the way it was said. It’s called emotional mind control. It’s been a big part of my work that I try to explain to people.


### Part 257
Where does the fear of true freedom come from? And this is going to lead into my future work, which is a whole other series of presentations. I’m gonna go deeply into this in the future. It’s very difficult to see here (pointing to the slide) there’s actually a tree there, it’s kind of in a deep red because I’m gonna put some text over top of it. I should’ve started it in a more bright red and then faded it into the background, but forgive that on this slide.


You can look it up here on the top of the tree, there’s the leaves. The leaves are: one’s refusal to own their own personal responsibility. Now you would think,
“oh well that’s way down at the root.” No. That’s the symptom that’s manifesting up at the top of the tree. That’s actually the leaves on the tree, the leaves and the twigs. Then we get down to the big branches and the trunk of the tree. We’re getting closer to the heart of the real psychological issues that are at work driving the negative aspect of the problem.


And this we’ve already talked about: self-loathing due to lack of self- respect. Now, what am I really describing here, what have we actually been describing?
what kind of people want to live in perpetual refusal to own personal responsibility because they have some nested traumatic issues that have led to self-loathing and lack of self-respect? What am I really describing there? (Audience response: slave) What? well yes, there’s a slave mind-set, but there’s something else that I’m describing. What kind of person is it? (Audience response: a child) a child, thank you. We’re talking about people who are psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually immature; they have not grown up. They have not accepted personal responsibility, which is a hallmark of true adulthood or maturity. And this is due to the trauma they’ve undergone that’s led to self-loathing and the lack of self-respect, which is why they don’t want personal responsibility; they want to remain an eternal child. Now, let’s find out what is at the root of this tree of evil, because until we go into this space, into this causal factor of these other manifesting psychological conditions, we’re not actually hitting the actual root of the actual problem. If a child doesn’t like themselves: they hate themselves, they feel they’re not good enough, they’re not worthy, they have all these imagined feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing, and that’s expressing their refusal to grow up and take personal responsibility for their selves in their adulthood. What kind of trauma, specifically, has that child more likely than not psychologically undergone? They’ve gone through a specific type of childhood trauma and I would argue that most people on earth have gone through this type of trauma, and that type of trauma is called abandonment.


The human species is suffering from very deeply seeded parental abandonment issues that lie at the very core of the psychological condition that we call the human condition. Until we deal with that nested psychological trauma that has been created through abandonment issues, we’re not hitting the roots of the tree of evil. We’re not getting down to the very core issue that needs to be understood. My future work: I’m going to be presenting this on December 12th in Philadelphia for anybody who’s in the philadelphia area. It’s going to be what would call a synthesis. An explanatory synthesis of why this is the root psychological condition of humanity. I call it comic abandonment, and this is going to be one of the biggest, biggest aspects of the next part of my work. I think it’s gonna really set my work apart from others in the truth and freedom community and the alternative research community. Until we wrestle with those psychological abandonment issues, we’re not getting to the heart of what’s causing these other problems in the human psyche like self-loathing, the lack of the development of self-respect, and the refusal to own the responsibility for one’s own actions. And I’m going to connect this with human origins and I’m going to make the case that it has always been like that. it has always been like that. We have been children on this planet since we have been on this planet, and we have never actually psychically, psychologically, and emotionally, and spiritually grown up because as a species, we have undergone what I term “cosmic abandonment.” So, that’s going to be coming up in future aspects of my work.


### Part 258
What will be required on the part of those performing this Great Work? and you know it is like Sisyphus rolling that boulder up the hill. We just got to get it up to the top and give it that one last push so we don’t have to keep doing it again. Who knows how many times we’re already tried to do this? And it’s ended in failure.


We need the knowledge of the real enemy- the real enemy, ok. And we’ll get to what that is.


We need to devote ourselves to Service To Truth, not even service to humanity. I’m not saying that’s not a great virtue to have and enact. I’m telling you we need to go beyond that. This isn’t about service to me, you, or any other individual; it’s about service to Truth and Principles first and foremost.


And we need courage and persistence.


And then we need practical real-world skills.


### Part 259
The knowledge of the real enemy needs to ultimately come first, and this isn’t it folks. This priest class, those elites who has the rituals at Bohemian Grove; I’m not telling you they’re not evil, I’m not telling you there not psychopaths, I’m not telling you that we don’t need people like that in the world. I’m telling you that in this spiritual war, this is a tiny tiny tiny tiny insignificant, as far as numbers are concerned, fraction of the totality of the human population that could not possibly control the minds, therefore the behaviors of the masses of people without our compliance, without our ignorance. so, while I’m not telling you I like these people, do I have respect for them as an opponent? Oh yea, you damn well better believe I do. I don’t underestimate these psychopaths, not a bit. Want to know why? I worked with them. I know what their will is like. I know what their intellect is like and I’m telling you don’t underestimate either one. I’m telling you don’t underestimate their care. Like I said, they don’t have care in the terms of compassion and the normal range of human emotions like we do, but don’t think that means they don’t have care. They deeply care about what they’re enacting, what their agenda is. They have the will to carry it out and they’re not slowing down. they’re unified; they’re on a unified front. They’re on the same page. Believe it. Know it. Like I said, reading about it and book knowledge (is different), I’ve been around these psychopaths. Haven’t specifically been to this psychopathic gathering (referring to the bohemian Grove), but I’ve been around them enough.


### Part 260
That’s not the real enemy, that is (referring to the slide). The sleeping masses, hypnotized masses; they’re your enemy. See, people will say, “the illuminati enslaves humanity.” No it doesn’t. Humanity enslaves the real illuminati. Think about that for a little bit. Do those psychopaths in the last slide really enslave us? And first of all, people who call them the illuminati, they’re no such thing. The illuminati means that you’re enlightened, the illuminated ones. You want to know whose the enlightened ones? They’re in this room. We’re the illuminati. The people who know what I’m talking about here are the illuminati. They’re the illuminated ones. They’re the ones with the light. They’re the ones with the real knowledge. They (dark occultists) want to refer themselves as the enlightened ones. They might have the dark sun, they don’t have the true sun, you know. They’re imbued with the black sun. That means it’s all intellectual knowledge and then you’re applying it for the totally immoral Wrong reasons, which is to control and manipulate other people. There’s nothing illuminated about that. So, the real illuminati; they’re not the enslavers of humanity. The dark
illuminati are not the enslavers of humanity either. Humanity enslaves itself and they’re enslaving the true illuminati, the teachers who are actually living under the conditions of slavery because they’re here with the ignorant people. That’s who’s being enslaved by humanity. Humanity are the enslavers, and this is another thing that’s highly unpopular. people don’t want to hear it. They want to think we’re powerless victims. There’s no choice involved here, this is just something that’s being done to us. And I’m here to tell you free will is always in existence and it’s a matter of changing one’s thoughts and therefore changing one’s choices. And that’s our own personal responsibility that can never be given away or shirked, or shrugged. We’re always responsible for what we are doing.


### Part 261
Service to Truth is required. Truth itself is eternal; can never be destroyed, but you know what? Humanity can be destroyed. We can be destroyed when we refuse to act in service to truth as her defenders. People say, “oh truth doesn’t need to be defended.” Nonsense. Truth needs to be defended at all times and places because the attack on it is never ending and non-stop. Continuous. And if we don’t come to her defense, you know what happens? The voice of untruth and deception and evil and mind control rules the day. And the voice of truth doesn’t get heard because the truth itself doesn’t have a physical voice in the physical domain. We have to be its mediums and we have to be its voice. It’s possible for us to co-create a positive outcome in this scenario, but this can only be accomplished if we care enough to learn the truth ourselves and then we develop the courage to continuously speak it to other people. Until our voice of truth becomes a non-stop chorus like the voice of lies and deception and mind control has been for millennia on this planet.


### Part 262
Courage is required. Samuel Adams encapsulated this brilliantly, he said:
“The Liberties of our country are worth defending at all hazards. It is our duty to defend them against all attacks. It will bring a mark of everlasting infamy on the present generation if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without any struggle, or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men.”


### Part 263
(Quoting Samuel Adams again) “If you love wealth greater than Liberty, if you love the tranquility of servitude greater than the animating contest for Freedom, then go home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were ever our countrymen.” Now that’s about as powerful as it gets as far as I’m concerned, because he’s telling you if your allegiance isn’t to the truth and freedom, I don’t want to know you. I don’t want to know you and we hope history forgets you ever were with us at this time and place in history because you deserve to be forgotten. That’s what he’s saying here, you know I couldn’t agree more.


### Part 264
Persistence is required, constant effort. We are the actual vehicles by which truth operates in the world, therefore it is our shared responsibility at this time to help to awaken others by continuously speaking the truth, even if we feel burdened by this task, even if we feel no one’s listening, and even if it makes all involved in this process feel uncomfortable. It’s not about feeling comfort folks, it’s not about staying complacent.
it’s about shaking things up. Making people feel uncomfortable. Who ever told anybody that the truth would make you all warm and fuzzy inside? Who ever told anybody that? why do people want to believe that? Who ever said that that was the case? The truth is horrible and yet needs to be embraced as lover with dedication to it, even in its full horror.


### Part 265
Thomas Paine, who I feel was the most enlightened person on the continent at the time of the American Revolution personally- he’s one of my personal heroes. He walked in the vicinity of where I walk sometimes now. He said: “these are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot, will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country. But he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us: that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” I think he was one of the true anarchists that was living amongst us in the colonial days.


### Part 266
Words attributed to the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama: he said, “there are only two mistakes that one can ever make on the path to Truth: not starting, and not going all the way.” All the way. I wrap up a lot of my podcasts with this quote because I love it so much. It’s about persistence, it’s not about saying “I went this far and now I’m uncomfortable to see the rest of the picture. I made it three quarters up the mountain, that’s far enough, let me set up my base camp here, I’ll pitch my tent and I’m staying here. No farther, I don’t want to see the peak.” Until we become fully enlightened and go all the way to the summit, don’t expect things to change, don’t expect them to get better. The truth has to be taken-in in its fullness.


### Part 267
We need real world practical skills you know. This isn’t just about: “oh I no this now and I don’t actually need any skills.” To communicate truth, skill is required. knowledge is required to reach a good amount of people. Yea you could just talk to the people around you. You could communicate to a small fraction of people that way. I’m not saying don’t do that, even if you don’t have these other skills. I’m saying if you want to get it out in a big way to the masses of people in the new form of media, which is doing things like this through the correct and positive and empowering use of technology. people want to say, “ah, technology, there’s no roll for it, we got to get rid of technology.” Technology is a thing that improves life at every scale and level. It’s a tool. It’s how it’s used, exactly (acknowledging comment from the audience). We’re using technology for a powerful and enlightening purpose right now, and that’s its intended use; it’s to serve humanity and to serve truth. Real world skills in the technological era, I feel, are absolutely required, and here’s some of them.


You need good organizational skills, like Art and Chris did this
(conference) right today- they set this up right. I’ve seen people set things up really badly and I’ve seen it done the correct way, which is this way. And Richard and Lisa, they’ve done a brilliant job here getting this all on film and this will be going online reaching a ton, a real wider base of people as a result. So you need organizational skills, some people are better with that than others. I’m pretty good with organization. I feel I have good powerful organization skills.


Communication skills: you need to have a way with words, you need to have a good vocabulary, you need to organize words correctly, you need to be able to communicate concepts, in often a very linear fashion to people so that they can readily absorb it easily. If you’re all over the place, they’re not going to get the concept.


You need graphic design skills in many cases. I couldn’t build a presentation like this without my background in graphic design and thank god I have it. I got jobs like I did in the past and sort of they prepared me for everything I was going to do in my future. Synchromystically worked out like that. But, you at least need to know how to lay out a flyer, folks. How many people here can lay out a simple flyer? (Raise of hands in the audience) that’s awesome. I’m so highly impressed by that. I’m telling you, I’ve asked people that in other presentations, like two people raised their hand. that’s awesome, you should be proud of that.

Presentation skills like putting something like this together. How many people have basic presentation skills with a computer? (Raise of hands in the audience) alright, a little less, but not bad either. I’m impressed.


Audio skills: sometimes you got to work with audio, and podcast audio, etc.

Video: video editing skills, I know Rich is a master at that.

Website development: this was laborious in the past, just ten years ago. we have free open source content management systems now, make this almost a breeze. there’s somewhat a little bit of a learning curve, but once you get there, hey, you’re off to the races. You could maintain multiple websites then. How many people can build a simple website by a show of hands? That’s also awesome. Kudos, who ever hates that word, whatever, but I’m telling you, that’s impressive. For the amount of people in one room to have all those skills, I’m impressed. It’s very rare.

Networking skills and I mean literally like people skills. I’m weak on this. i can do it. I don’t like doing it.

I don’t like marketing and promotion either. I’m not a good marketer of my work. I’m trying to get better at that, but I need some work with that and maybe there’s people who can help me with that, but I have a good chunk of all these skills. I could do all of them, I’m not so good on the last two, I need more work, but if most of us don’t have the skills, we’re not going to be reaching the optimum number of people we need to become the new media that is dedicated to Truth and put that out there for other peoples’ consumption and other peoples’ edification. We are the answer. We are the illuminators; the ones who will help to enlighten people once we’ve taken this knowledge into ourselves. And then, that’s only the beginning folks. You got to put it back out there.
i tell people this story: I had all this knowledge for a long time, sitting on it, doing nothing with it. Just taking more in: “oh, I want to make sure I got it all right, I want to make sure I got the whole picture.” I go to a meeting in the state of Virginia. Virginia,
Virgin; the goddess, care. Very synchronistic. A woman comes up to me and says:
“you’re one of the most knowledgeable people I’ve come across, what are you doing?” so what do you mean what am I doing? She said, “I mean, what are you doing with all the knowledge you have? Are you doing lectures, presentations, videos, audio, what are you doing?” I’m not doing any of those things, I’m just taking a lot more in, downloading a lot more videos. She goes like this, and it’s just so matter-of-factly and harshly: “what makes you think you have the Right to that? What makes you think you can keep taking all of this information in, all of this in, all of this in, and not put any of it back out? What makes you think you even have a Right to do that?” It was like somebody hit me in the face. This was her phrase, she said: (I’ll never forget it) “you’re niagara Falls in a water balloon. You’re taking all this in and all this pressure pressure, pressure building up; it’s got no outlet. It’s going to burst.” She said “you have to put an outlet valve on that knowledge and let it flow out of you and go out to others and then more will come in. Right now there’s now pressure release valve. You’re Niagara Falls in a water balloon.” It’s like a truck ran me over. Literally like I got hit by a truck. I came up with the idea for ‘What On Earth Is Happening’ (.com) a couple weeks after that because it’s all I could think about. All I could think about is what she said; kept echoing in my head: “what makes you think you have a Right to do that?” And didn’t say it nice. said it like “you’re not doing the Right thing here, get up off your ass and do something.” that was the tone of the said in, and I totally appreciate it. Who knows, if that wasn’t said to me at that time I might not have done a thing. You never know. I like to think at some point I would have.
