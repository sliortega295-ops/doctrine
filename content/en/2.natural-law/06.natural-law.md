title: Natural Law
description: Natural Law is a set of universal, objective, eternal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions which govern the consequences of behaviors of beings with the capacity for understanding the difference between harmful and non-harmful actions.
---

## Etymology
The word *__Natural__* is derived from the Egyptian word *__Neter__* (also *__Ntr__*) which translates to "Spirit, God" and the suffix *__-al__*, which, just as in English, means: "Related to, of, having come from". Therefore, it can be readily seen that the word *__Natural__* _(Neter + -al)_ means "Related to- or, having come from Spirit or God".

## Meaning
Natural Law means the universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of behavior for intelligent species; Beings that are capable of coming to an understanding of their own existence, and their consciousness. And also capable of understanding the objective difference between harmful and non-harmful behavior towards themselves and other beings. This does not include the animal kingdom. For the very same reason you wouldn't attempt to teach mathematics to your cat or dog, this same goes for animals understanding Natural Law. This is because we don't share the same level of consciousness.

<!-- There are differences in levels of consciousness, and a being's abilities to comprehend information. Not every being has the ability to come to an understanding of how something like Natural Law works. Therefore, we are held to different standards when it comes to us understanding Natural Law. -->

## Power Differential
Sadly, within the human population such knowledge also isn't commonly known, because it has been deliberately hidden in order to create and maintain a power differential between those who know that information, and those who are ignorant of it.

##  Level the Playing Field
The knowledge of Natural Law and the way it operates constitute some of the most deeply occulted information on Earth, which the powers that be seek to keep hidden from the people, because the understanding of this information would level the playing field and put an end to the currently operating systems of control.

## Transcript

### Part 18 (Cont.)

the first major body of occult knowledge constitutes knowledge of human consciousness, how it works, how it operates, what our motivations are, things like that. the second body of occult knowledge is called the greater arcana, or the major arcana. and again, this doesn’t refer to that it’s more important, it refers to the macrocosmic understanding, the understanding of the very large laws of nature that govern the macrocosm. Universal Laws are part of the greater arcana of occult knowledge and what i call here today under the umbrella, the term Natural Law, falls into that second category of greater knowledge, the greater arcana of occult knowledge. What these Natural Laws are, are unseen and universal, spiritual laws.

we could talk about the word natural here too. Natural is derived from Egyptian and other Middle Eastern tradition languages. The word neter in Egyptian, which would’ve been spelled without vowels if we transliterated it, would be “NTR” in English. Neter means spirit in ancient Egyptian. The suffix al , even in English today, but if you go back to Arabic languages and ancient Middle Eastern languages, al as a suffix actually means of or related to, or having come from. So, natural, if you put these root words together, neter and al , it means of or related to the realm of spirit, of or related to God. Actually, the word neter also meant God, spirit or God. This is the spiritual domain, the laws that actually are operating in the unseen realm. Now, they manifest in the physical realm. we’re gonna talk about that, because that’s the operation that trickles down from; it starts in the spiritual domain and then it manifests in the physical domain.

so it’s important to understand these two bodies of knowledge; the lesser arcana is about the monad, or the individuated unit of consciousness of the human being and then the greater knowledge is about the laws that govern the macrocosmic universe. What these laws do, this body of the working of nature that I’m calling under the umbrella Natural Law, they’re universal spiritual laws, which govern the consequences of behavior. They govern the consequences of behavior and I would add a caveat to that; they govern the consequences of behavior for intelligent species, for beings that are capable of coming to their understanding. I would delineate that from the animal kingdom. The animal kingdom is not held to the same standard as human beings when it comes to this body of information because I don’t think you’re going to sit down with your cat and explain natural Law to it. So when people say, “well why doesn’t the animal kingdom be held to account the same way human beings are,” it’s because, surprise surprise, we don’t share the same level of consciousness. There is differences in levels of consciousness and abilities to comprehend information and to actually know how something works. Just like you will not be explaining physics to your dog any time soon, you’re not going to explain Natural Law to the animal kingdom and have them grasp it because they’re not at the same level of consciousness as we are. So we are held to a different account when it comes to Natural Law. “It governs human behavior” would be and easy way of saying it.
this body of knowledge has actually been called consequentialism by past researchers and teachers, and I no problem with that term. I’ve actually looked into consequentialism and it’s quite similar in its scope and what it teaches. It’s been called karma; Karmic law in many Middle Eastern and Eastern Traditions, and I have no problem with that term for it either. It has been called in some of the Western Traditions and Christian traditions, Moral Law. And I have no problem with that term either. Religionists have called it God’s Law, and I have no problem with that term either. I have no problem with any of these terms being applied to the umbrella of Natural Law because that is essentially what it is. But we’re going to get deeply into how it works and operates in our lives here today.


### Part 19
Why is this knowledge hidden away from people? To what ends? The knowledge of the occult, the hidden knowledge about how Natural Law works and how consciousness works is not commonly known. That’s why it’s not the exoteric, it’s not given to the masses. It’s the esoteric, it is reserved for the few, and there is a reason for that. It’s been deliberately hidden away and kept from the general public in order to create and maintain a power differential because if someone else is in extreme level of knowledge and they know how something works, like something as trivial as how human consciousness works, how human motivations work, how human perceptions work, how human beings can be manipulated. Somebody has deep knowledge of that information and there’s a whole bunch of people over here who have not one iota of how that works. what kind of a number do you think somebody could do on people like that? the way I ask people to look at this is real simple; imagine a very very very advanced psychologist, at the top of his field, wrote all the textbooks. And he’s got a house out in the burbs and he comes into the university, he’s got tenure, he’s got the trophy wife, house out in the suburbs, three car garage, driving the Lexus into work at his tenure job and he finds out that his trophy wife is having an affaire because she’s bored. She’s not satisfied with him at home and it’s maybe the nineteen-year-old captain of the local high school football team or something. He’s a senior star football player, he’s a jock and she just has a fling with him. Well, what if he decides “I’m going to become buddy buddy with my boy here” after finding out about his wife’s affaire, and this kid, this punk, who my wife’s cheating on me with, he knows nothing. He doesn’t study the mind, he doesn’t even know anything about himself. He watches TV six hours a day, plays violent video games, is obsessed with football. What kind of a number you think that psychologist can do on that kid? Total number, that’s the answer, exactly, that’s right. He could do a total number on him. He can gain his confidence, he can get into his head and I grantee you, you give him a little bit of time, he could screw up his life based on what he knows and how he would be able to manipulate based on his hatred of that person. Well guess what? That’s the position humanity is in. we’re that punk jock, and I’m not saying we necessarily did something to deserve it, but we’re in that same position, where the people with this knowledge at the highest levels, they hate us, and they’re doing a total number on us. Because we don’t have this knowledge and until that changes, don’t expect the playing field to be levelled. Expect it to get worse. The knowledge is hidden to create and maintain a power differential between those who hold it and those who are ignorant of it, it’s that simple.

### Part 20
The knowledge of Natural Law and its operations constitutes what I call the most deeply occulted or hidden information that exists on this planet. You will not find any more hidden information. This is the thing that all the distractions are there for to keep you from learning. The endless trivialities, the nonsense you hear on the news, all the video games, all the nonsense television, the sports; it’s all there to keep people from understanding this. And I can’t get you to accept that or believe it and I don’t ask you to believe it. I’m telling you that’s what they’re trying to (do), from my years of being inside occult traditions that are very very dark. I’m telling you this is what they don’t want you to know, from first hand experience. How many people here today know that I was involved in the dark occult in my past? Good (few hands raised). The “powers that be” seek to keep this information hidden from the people of the earth at all costs because understanding this information about Natural Law will level the playing field and put an end to the currently entrenched systems of control that are operating on the earth.
