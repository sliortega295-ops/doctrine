## Definition

**_Consciousness_** is the ability of a being to recognize patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place; both within oneself, and in the realm in which the being exists and operates. In other words...

## Expressions of Consciousness
The abilities we have, to make ourselves known to any other being around us. These expressions are:

## Thoughts
Creative (neutral) force. (both Masculine and Feminine).  

## Emotions:
Internal expression. (Feminine).   

## Actions
Result of thought and emotion being expressed into the physical realm. (Masculine)

Like in almost all major religious traditions, this represents the 'Holy Trinity':
The father creator (thoughts), and the sacred feminine figure (emotions), which the father
figure impregnates or inseminates in some way. From that offspring a male child is born, always. The birth of this male child symbolizes that the 'saviour' of humanity will be action; faith alone will not be enough.

Even in modern Christianity, in their own exoteric scriptures, there is only one prescription
that the Christ-figure gives to the people when asked about freedom (John 8:32) -

You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.

let's look consciousness and the human brain because consciousness is an intangible force. It's something that exists, but you can't really see it. Many people have a hard time explaining what it is. But there is physiological expressions for consciousness in the physical domain and the brain is one of them. And of course people will say; “well don't leave out the heart.” Of course the heart is also very important, the heart has an even bigger electromagnetic field than the brain and is tied into the physiology in an even more complex way than the brain is, but we need to understand the base structure of the brain to understand the types of imbalances that go on within it that lead to these debilitating conditions within humanity that continue to create suffering for us. And also what these belief systems do, is they prevent the activation of the heart and the actions, of care and action. Not only do they prevent knowledge, real knowledge from manifesting within the being, they prevent care and they create apathy and they create inaction, laziness, and cowardice, so that we don't actually act and take action based upon what we've come to know.

Let's look at how the brain and consciousness actually work. People will also try to give ridiculously over complicated and mystified definitions of what consciousness means and many people are even scared of the term. We have to de-mystify these terms and bring them down to real simple English and real simple concepts that the average person can grasp, and stop trying to make it more complicated than it is. Being conscious of something, meaning having consciousness of it is an ability of the being to recognize patterns, remember, this is all about pattern recognition. To recognize patterns and meaning with respect to events that are taking place, or have taken place, both within one's self; in the inner realm, in the lesser realm, the realm of the individuated consciousness, and in the realm in which the self exists and operates, the macrocosm.

let's break it down: ability of a being to recognize patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place within one's self, the microcosm, and in the macrocosmic world, the world at large. And the events taking place is the truth. So it's our ability to accurately perceive truth of what has happened and what is happening. That's consciousness. that's consciousness, and it's made way overly complicated by people. It's mostly made overly complicated in the new age movement again, which I can't stress enough how big of a deception it is. People really need to go check out my work on the new age deception. It's on my website, it's in the video section and it's in the podcast section; it's a seven hour presentation and I'm telling you, it will be as worth while for you to check out as this seminar.

So, that's what consciousness is. Now how does consciousness express? there's a difference between what it is and how it expresses in our life. I ask people,
“tell me, what are the ways you could ever make yourself known to any other being?” how can any other being come to know who you are in this incarnation, in this physical manifestation? How could they possibly come to know you? How could you manifest yourself or make yourself known to them? And there's only three ways: thoughts, emotions, and actions. And I would say speech falls into the combination of thoughts and emotions, and speech is also a form of action; I'm using force to make the air flow over my vocal chords to make sounds come out so you can hear the concepts I'm trying to express, so it is a form of action and it derives from what we have thought up to this point and the emotions that we have and we can express it through speech. Thought, emotion and action: thought you have to look at as the creative force that is the expression for consciousness within the individual. It's a neutral force; you don't look at your thoughts as masculine or feminine do you? But you do look at them as creative forces. In order for anything to manifest in the physical domain, it had to first exist as a thought. This computer, somebody had to envision all the parts, how it works, how it's put together. This camera equipment, the clothes you're wearing, the seats, everything that exists had to first exist in the realm of thought. Had to, by law. Then it comes into physical manifestation through action.
your emotions are a polarized component you can look at it as. It is a feminine aspect of consciousness because other people don't feel your emotions, they could perceive or sense them. You're the one who's feeling the emotions in your physiology. It's an internal expression. You feel emotions inwardly, inside in the physiology. Hence, this is a feminine expression for consciousness. It is something that is not externalized and put out, it is something that is felt within. So the emotions in the mind-body-spirit connection are the spirit in which we do something. So that's the feminine force or the spirit. Of course thoughts are within our mind, hence that's the mind component of the consciousness. Then there's a marriage between them. You could look at thoughts as the creative essence, which then blends with or marries to the feminine.

see, we're getting into a notion that is taught in many religious traditions. It's called the trinity. I challenge anybody, go and look at any of the trinity's that exist in any of the religions; you can go back to Babylon, you can go to the Indus Valley traditions, you can go to the Egyptian and Khemetian traditions, the Christian traditions. Every single religious tradition that has talked of a trinity: it is always a father creator, a sacred feminine figure of some kind that the father then impregnates or inseminates in some form, and then from that offspring, is born a male child. Always. What we're talking about here is the father being the mind, the creative essence, then the spirit or the emotions being the sacred feminine essence or the Holy Spirit, the emotions. And then the child, the male child is behavior, it is the active or masculine principle that actually interacts with the physical world to change it. Hence, that is the only way to actually save ourselves. And gain, people in religious thinking will immediately attack this and say; “you're saying that saving ourselves will not come through faith.” Yes I am. Saving ourselves will only come through action. Action will save humanity. Faith will not do it. so, sorry to again, smash another egoic attachment that people have to religious notions.

These religions are created by the control system. People don't understand that exoteric christianity is created by the dark occult of the ancient dark occult mystery schools. they don't understand where this religion came from because they haven't studied astrotheology. I'm not telling you there's no good concepts in any religion. I say take all the good concepts and leave the nonsense because one of the nonsense is that “you need to believe in something to be saved from the current human condition.” You don't need to believe in a thing, you need to know the truth, and right in their own religion there it is. let me just stay on this for a moment because in their own scripture, the exoteric christian scriptures, what is the one prescription that the Christ figure gives to the people when he is asked about freedom? He's only asked about freedom like once in the gospels, in the words attributed to his teachings. And they want to know what will save us, what will make us free? And what is his prescription? (Audience response) no, that is not, there's something missing there, you're close. What is the actual saying? Know the Truth. Knowing the Truth will make you free. That's the prescription, even in exoteric Christianity. It's right there in the gospels, but Christians don't want to hear that because the controllers in the church who came from the dark priest class gave them this nonsense that all you have to do is believe and everything will magically change. Well good luck with that when people's behaviors have no alignment with morality. You think your belief is going to change something? Again, let me know how that works out for you. And again, I'm not mincing words up here, I'm telling it like it really is. I don't care who it offends.

So, the expressions for consciousness are thoughts, emotions and actions which are likened to, in the consciousness community of mind, spirit and body, and it's a trinity: a father creator which is the thoughts, the mind. The feminine essence, which is the mother of the trinity: the emotions, the inward aspects, the spirit. And then they give birth when the thoughts and the emotions come together, they give birth to action in the world, which is the male child. This is very important to understand. I hope everybody is clear; this is our internal trinity, which constitutes the expressions for consciousness.
we're going to stop right there and take a break. We will resume at 1:15pm precisely, okay. So if you want to come in a few minutes early to get settled, I will start again at 1:15pm. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

PART 2
okay, welcome back everyone. I hope everybody had a really good lunch and is energized for the afternoon session. I'm gonna go until about 3:20 PM in the first part of this and we'll take a 10 minute break there and then we'll start in again about 3:30 and we'll go until five and then we'll come to our dinner break.
