Knowledge is the only solution; and the propagation of that knowledge is Education.

## Education

The word **_Education_** derives from the Latin verb **_Educere_** means "to Take, to Draw, or to Lead out from". Leading a person out of darkness (ignorance) is what a real teacher does. 

Rather than “pushing” a person out of that darkness, the teacher will go first and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accurate path, that person can follow the same discovery process.

::note
This education process must be a repeatable process; as was mentioned earlier, Natural Law isn't a religion or a belief system, it is a science.

### Part 240
TEACHING NATURAL LAW TO OTHERS: aLSO KNOWN AS THE GREAT WORK
so let’s look at some solutions. I call this section teaching Natural Law to others because as we’re talking about education is the only solution, knowledge is the solution; the propagation of that knowledge is education, which means to lead out from. Educare in latin means to lead one out from something. And what is education? It means to lead one out of darkness, out of ignorance. That’s what a real teacher does; doesn’t push somebody out, it says “I’m going to go first and show you the way, and you could follow if you feel this is the accurate path.” But you can do the same discovery process; it’s a repeatable process, that’s what a science is, which I’ve said this is not a belief system or religion, it is a science. This is also known; teaching Natural Law to others, which is what I am doing, has been called in all of the positive occult traditions, The Great Work. i call it The True Great Work because the dark occultists take everything, twist it around and they have their own variant of the “great work,” which is creating a world of total slavery. That’s the dark great work. I call this the True Great Work, or the Light Great work, however you want to refer to it as, it’s just a piece of jargon, it’s just a tag we put on it.
