This Online Guide is based in its entirety on the masterpiece seminar by Mark Passio. [Natural Law - The Real Law of Attraction](https://www.markpassio.com/videos); and the thesis by Michael Gleeson which is based entirely on the same video presentation by Mark.

## Mark Passio
Mark Passio is an independent researcher, public speaker, radio talk show host, conference organizer and freedom activist from Philadelphia, PA.

In 2007, Mark began presenting this knowledge in the form of a presentation series entitled What On Earth Is Happening, with the intention of bringing the implications of this body of knowledge to greater public awareness. 

All of his other presentations are well worth watching as well and they can all be found on YouTube, or on his website [WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com](https://whatonearthishappening.com). Mark also does a weekly video-podcast on topics related to Natural Law, and many other subjects of importance to achieving human freedom.

His website, MichaelGleesonMedia.com, is an accumulation of video footage, books, documents, and audio files pertaining to the expansion of human consciousness and getting the people of Earth closer to achieving true freedom for all.
