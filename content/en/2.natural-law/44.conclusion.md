## The Master Key
This process should be able to be done a lot faster than a few hundred years; if we accept the master key that is shown in this guide. Which has the power to unlock all the locks, and all the doors, to all the mental cages, if we make the decision to climb the "ladder of consciousness" through an act of our own free will choice and effort. Because for most it won't be an easy process; it involves a lot of deep introspective work.

However, if we do this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves, by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine forces within each one of us. And by recognizing our own inherent sovereignty, and recognizing there isn't, and never has been any legitimacy to slavery, control, authority or any other form of external rulership of human beings as subjects.

## Justice
The tarot card pictured here was also shown at the beginning of this guide. There is a deep connection to be understood about the tarot tradition and other mystery traditions regarding knowledge of Natural Law. Specifically, the deeply interwoven relationship to the Middle-Eastern Kabbalistic tradition.

This tarot card is known as the Justice Card (Justice: based on the Latin word **_Jus_** meaning "Right or Law"). This card represents balance between the two pillars of Enlightenment (Feminine and Masculine), Holding the sword of truth in the right hand, and the scales of justice perfectly balanced in the left hand.

This Justice card represents sovereignty, alignment with truth, and the manifestation of order, which can only happen when we align our behaviors to the principles of Natural Law.

## True Freedom
If we let go of the habits that are holding us back and break the mental chains of bondage, we can create a world that is based on true freedom. It may be a difficult journey, but it can be done. And if we all choose to do so, we're going to see advances and creations beyond what we have ever experienced here on Earth. The world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of Natural Law. The changes we will experience are going to be so positive, and so transformative that we can barely even imagine what the world will look like on the other side of that work.

It is up to each and every one of us, personally, to take on that responsibility and go down that path for ourselves; should we hope to ever reach that point. The main task now is to inform as many people as possible about the workings of Natural Law, true morality, and freedom.

## Transcript

### Part 276
This is a painting by Alex Grey that shows the worldview schism. Are we going to stay embedded in the left-brain and other forms of imbalance where we’re going to create the negative worldview?


### Part 277
Or are we going to live in harmony with Natural Law, which can create this path. When we incorporate the creative and nurturing and sacred feminine aspect of our beings. Natural Law, living in harmony with it, can only lead to these conditions: freedom, Peace, Prosperity, the continuation of our species, our actual physical survival and our evolutionary progress in consciousness. That’s what living in harmony with natural Law will lead us to.


### Part 278
Conversely, living in opposition to Natural Law will get us this side of the world tree. It will bring us this world, this hellish world of chaos and destruction because living in opposition to Natural Law can only lead to these states: Control, Enslavement, war, Chaos, Evolutionary Stagnation and ultimately the extinction of our species. Which will we choose? That’s still up in the air. I can’t tell you that. Only each individual can make that decision for themself and then that will play out in the aggregate, in the mass consciousness, the numbers.


### Part 279
Thomas Jefferson said: “a free people claim their Rights as derived from the laws of Nature,” and this was also embedded in the declaration of independence; the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God. “And not as the gift of their magistrates.”


### Part 280
John Locke said that: “the Natural Liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of Man, but only to have the Law of Nature for his rule.”


### Part 281
Former Grande Master of The Order of The Rose Cross, The Rosicrucian tradition, Francis Bacon said: “ Nature, to be commanded, must first be obeyed.” If we want the forces of the cosmos on our side, we have to learn and adhere to the Principles
of Natural Law. If we do not align our behavior to that, Nature will not stand with us; it will continuously stand against us, and it will itself create more strife and suffering in our lives. And we certainly won’t command it, we won’t command its forces with things like free energy used for any positive purpose, it will only be used for destructive purposes.


### Part 282
The psychologist Alfred Adler said: “there is a Law that man should love his neighbor as himself,” and he’s referring of course here to the golden rule. “In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing, or the upright gait. But if he does not learn it, he must perish.” And you know folks, I would really hope this is going to take less than a few hundred years, but based on where we’re at, I’m not so sure.


### Part 283
I think we could do it a lot faster than that if we accept the Key that’s been shown here today, that as I said before, has the power to unlock al the locks on all the doors to all the cages, and that’s what the knowledge of Natural Law comprises.


### Part 284
Will we make the choice to climb the ladder of consciousness through an act of our own free will choice and effort? It’s not a simple climb, I mean it’s a difficult climb. It’s not overly complicated to learn these concepts, to learn these truths. It involves abandoning many things that we’ve already been conditioned with that don’t serve who we are. But I’m not telling you it’s going to be easy. It involves a lot of deep introspective work.


### Part 285
But if we do it, we can step out of the prison that we’ve imposed upon ourselves by balancing the sacred feminine and masculine forces within each one of us.


### Part 286
And by recognizing our own inherent sovereignty, and that there is no legitimacy and never has been any legitimacy to slavery and control, and the external rulership of human beings as subjects. That recognition of sovereignty has to go hand-in- hand with our knowledge of Natural Law, it’s a totally integrated component of it.


### Part 287
This was the title slide, this card, this tarot card was on the title slide. I’ve talked about this in some of my work online: when you understand the deep connection to the tarot tradition and other mystery tradition teachings, specifically its very deep interwoven relationship to the Kabbalistic Tradition, of the Middle Eastern mystery traditions, you understand that this card right here actually represents the Will of Creation and what creation itself, what the mind of the universe itself, ultimately wants to manifest in physical reality. Not in some other worldly dream world or fantasy realm or spiritual reality that is to come or not come. Right here in the physical domain, which is not separate and distinct from the spiritual domain; they are one in the same. This card is known as the justice card, and it’s based on the Latin word jus, which means Right, or law. That’s where we get the English word justice. This card represents balance between the pillars as you see on the right side of the king holding the Sword of Truth in the right hand and the Scales of Truth and Justice have been perfectly balanced and are in the other hand. And it represents sovereignty and it represents alignment with Natural law, and most of all it represents alignment with Truth and the Manifestation of Order. that can only happen when we align our behaviors to the Principles of Natural Law.
only then will we see the manifestation that the universe itself wishing for us and trying to help us create, which is Justice and Order.


### Part 288
If we let go of the things that are holding us back and break our mental chains of bondage, we can create a world that is based in actual real freedom. It is possible, I’m not telling you it’s not going to be arduous work or a difficult journey, but it can be done. If we choose to do that, we’re going to see advances and things that are going to be created


### Part 289
That the world is going to look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to the Truth and to Order and to Justice; the understanding of Natural Law and actually applying it and living it in our lives, that the changes we’re going to experience are going to be so positive and so transformative, we can scarcely even imagine what the world will be like on the other side of that work, on the other side of that transformation.


### Part 290
Will that be done? Maybe. Maybe not. The answer will come from what you see in the reflection of that device right there (referring to the mirror). That’s what will determine it. Nothing else. It’s up to each individual.


### Part 291
LEX REX
ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your kind attention today. (Crowd applause) thank you, thank you, I appreciate that. Finally, this right here: Lex Rex simply means the Law is King. The Law (Natural Law) is King, Lex Rex. That’s my final slide. Thanks so much.
let’s do some question and answer. How much do we have by the way, did I run way over or did I leave some? Oh my god. Hey, I’m very happy that the venue allowed us to go over by this much and that they didn’t just come in and say “you gotta get out of here.” So, I really did want to leave time for questions but I think I would be, I don’t know if it would be really just, you know, intrusive and ignorant at this point to just stay even beyond this time, so maybe we should start packing it up, alight. I apologize for going so far over (the time) but I think the information speaks for itself and has worked it and I hope I clarified it. Listen, I’ll tell you what, if anybody has specific questions, since there’s no time for questions, let me just get this across. Since there’s no time for questions, I’ll make a personal effort, and I rarely tell people I will respond to email questions. Tell me specifically that you attended this seminar here today in an email and if you have a specific question, get to the specific question quickly in your email and I will make the time over the next few weeks to try to respond to everybody, I promise that. How’s that? Does that sound okay? Alright great. Thank you (applause from the audience). Thank you guys all so much for being here, for staying for the whole thing. thank you, I’m very impressed with you guys today. That takes a tremendous effort of will and attention, so thank you guys so much.
