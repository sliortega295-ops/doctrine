## Statism
A Statist is a person who erroneously believes that there is such a thing as “authority” vested in certain people, giving them the “right” to rule over others. This “authority” means that certain people, who call themselves 'government,' have the moral right to issue commands to those whom they rule (those under their jurisdiction), and that their subjects (slaves) have a “moral obligation” to obey the arbitrary dictates (laws) set by their “masters.” 

::note
Most simply put, a statist is someone who believes in the legitimacy of slavery.
::

## Anarchy
Conversely, an Anarchist is a person that knows there could never be legitimacy to “authority” or “government” because those terms are simply euphemisms for violence and slavery, which are always immoral and in opposition to Natural Law.

The word **_Anarchy_** is derived from the Greek prefix **_An-_** (αν-) which means "Without, or the Absence of" and the Greek noun **_Archon_** (αρχων)' which means "Master, or Ruler". Anarchy does not mean "Without rules". It literally means "Without Rulers, or Without Masters". 

The only permanent rules that are in place, are the ones of Natural Law.

::note
No Masters = No Slaves
::

It seems self-evident that **_Anarchy_** is the true meaning of freedom, and yet, when you ask a  person what anarchy means (to them), and what they associate it with, the answer will most likely be: rioting, looting and destroying other people's property, in one word; chaos. Which is literally the exact opposite of what anarchy truly is.

### Transcript

#### Slide 196
So a statist is an individual who erroneously believes there's such a thing as authority that is vested in certain human beings, magically giving them the right to rule over other people. This authority means that certain people, who we call government, have the “moral right” to issue commands to those whom they rule, those under their jurisdiction. And that their subjects or slaves have a “moral obligation” to obey the arbitrary dictates or “laws,” that are set by their masters. Most simply put, a statist is nothing more than someone who believes in the legitimacy of slavery.

#### Slide 197
Conversely, an anarchist, a true anarchist anyway, is one who knows that there could never be legitimacy to authority or government because those terms are simply euphemisms for violence and slavery and coercion, which are always immoral and in opposition to Natural Law.


#### Slide 198
Let's look at what the word anarchy really means. Again, you've got to break it down: from the Greek prefix an, which means without or the absence of, and the
greek noun archon there (on the slide) written in Greek script, which means master or ruler. And again, I mean externally, one who externally rules another or claims to be the master of another. That's what the term archon means in its connotation. Anarchy, as we can see by putting these together, does not mean without rules. The word archon does not mean rules, okay? Because there's always going to be rules in effect called Natural law. The laws of morality. It means rulers, imposed rulers. That's what archon means in Greek. It literally means, anarchy, now putting it together: an absence of archon, master or ruler, the absence of masters or rulers, externally imposed masters or rulers. meaning, when we put it together, it means without rulers, without masters. Now, if you give people that term, no masters, no rulers, no masters, no slaves. What word are they going to associate those phrases with? Freedom! But if you tell people “what does anarchy mean to you? What do you associate it with?” What are they going to tell you? chaos, which is the exact opposite. That's in that other column (referring to the Natural law Expressions slide). They have deliberately obfuscated the meaning of the word through a mind-control technique called endless repetition. If I could keep telling you a word doesn't mean what it means: “that's not a projector, hat's a hammer. Hey, could you check out my hammer over there and make sure it's projecting the image on the board correctly? You know, the bulb burned out in my hammer, I might need to go buy a new hammer.” If I kept doing that endlessly, endlessly, endlessly for years and years and years, people would start calling that device a hammer if I got enough people to keep calling it that, so they've gotten enough people to call freedom, chaos! Think about that. they've got enough people to believe that the absence of the state of slavery means chaos instead of freedom. It's almost unfathomable. It's almost incomprehensible. The mind job that's been done on this species, it's almost incomprehensible.


#### Slide 199
Anarchy is the state of existence where there are no masters and no slaves. therefore, what it really means is the absence of slavery, or in other words, True freedom. That's all it means. I prefer to call it anarchony. Okay. Keeping the entire word archon instead of taking out the O-N. If we keep that there and call it anarchony, and I say I’m an anarchonist, people will ask “what the hell is that?” And then you could really break the word down and say the absence of archons, the absence of those who would claim to be masters over a population of slaves. That's what an anarchonist is. It's saying “that's illegitimate, that's unnecessary and that we need to do away with that state of existence.”


#### Slide 200
Okay, so we look at these two, this true divide again, the statist and the anarchist. I call the statist the archonist: this is somebody who believes in the legitimacy of the archons, the rulers. And I'll be talking about in future presentations, the concept of the archons more in future presentations.
and the anarchist as it's been called, I think should be called the called the anarchonist because that's somebody who knows that there's no legitimacy to the mastery over other people, or the rulership externally over others, keeping them as slaves or subjects. There is no legitimacy to that, and that's the one true divide that separates all consciousness here on the earth. The real divide and the real enlightenment comes: “do you understand there is no legitimacy to slavery, or do you continue to believe that there's legitimacy to slavery?” That's the divide in consciousness that has to be bridged.
