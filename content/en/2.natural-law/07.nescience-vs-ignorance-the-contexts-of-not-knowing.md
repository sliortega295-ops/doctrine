## Nescience
There are two contexts to not knowing something; the first term 'Nescience' is derived from the Latin verb 'Nescire,' which means 'to Not know something because necessary information was absent or unattainable.' The prefix 'Ne-' in Latin means 'Not / Not Present / Absent.' The second part of the word nescience is derived from the Latin verb 'Scio / Sciero' which means 'I know.'

Therefore, in case of nescience it is impossible for a person to aggregate necessary information. Contrary to ignorance, nescience isn't a person's fault; the information simply isn't available for them to perceive.

## Ignorance
The term 'Ignorance' is derived from the Latin verb 'Ignorare' which means 'to Not know something, even though necessary information is present; because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.' This is usually because of disinterest or contradicting beliefs. Ignorance, contrary to nescience, carries blame. Because the person has wilfully chosen to ignore the information.

For the vast majority of people this information is readily available to them, but most people choose to ignore it because they feel they don't need to know it, or because it contradicts something they believe in. Therefore, we live in an ignorant society.

## Your Master Key
What this guide constitutes is a master-key it is accepted (not believed). This process starts by perceiving truth's presence, acknowledging truth's presence, accepting it for what it truly is, and then finally and most importantly, to do something with it.

Understanding this information is not where this work ends; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, action is required.

## Courage to Change
People often say, 'change happens in the heart' or 'change happens in the mind,' which is true, but lastly it happens in the guts. If you have the “guts” to do something, you have developed the courage to do something. We must develop all three, heart, mind and guts; we must care enough to know, and then finally convert that knowledge into action. Because taking action is the most important step towards creating change in the physical realm.

## Transcript

### Part 21
We should very clearly make a distinguishment between nescience and ignorance, so that people fully understand the difference between these two concepts. How many people even have heard the term nescience? Very few. This is a word that has practically been sanitized from colloquial English. Practically been sanitized from the English language, and there’s a reason for that too. There’s two contexts to not knowing something, the first context is nescience. Nescience comes from Latin, the prefix ne in Latin means not, or not present, or absent. And then `scio`, `sciere` in Latin means to know, it’s where we get the word science from. So you put them together, ne-science, and actually those two roots form another word; ne-sciere. Nesciere in Latin means not to know, to not know, to not understand, but there’s a connotation to it. It means to not understand because the specific information that you may be having a desire to understand is completely absent, it is not present and you cannot actually aggregate that information. You can’t bring those pieces of grammar together to form the sentence. It’s not present, so you don’t have it, at all. It’s unattainable. This should be clearly delineated from ignorance. Now, nescience is not someone’s fault. The information just isn’t there. You can’t be blamed for nescience. There is no blame in nescience. The person who is nescient is not to be blamed for being nescient. The information simply wasn’t present so they could take it in and then come to understand it.

Ignorance carries blame. This is another thing people want to think in the new age movement there’s no such thing as. “Nobody’s to blame.” That goes to that “there’s no cause for anything that’s happening,” as you’ll hear a lot in the new age circles. I very strongly put down these notions or attempt to. There are causes and effects; there are people who are responsible for what is happening. There is blame. Blame exists. There are people who are culpable. We’re going to talk about moral culpability later. So ignorance has blame attached to it and responsibility attached to it. It comes from the latin verb ignorare , in Latin and this means not to know, just like nescience means not to know, but in a completely different connotation. The connotation of ignorance means; you don’t know even though necessary information is present and right there before you because you have willfully refused or disregarded that information. Whether you’ve refused it because it made you uncomfortable or whether you disregarded it because you felt “that’s not important for me to know, I don’t need to know that.” Or you feel you already understand something that contradicts with the new thing you’re hearing or seeing. When you willfully disregard something, if I wanted to willfully disregard the gentleman sitting in the front row, he’s present, I could just pretend he’s not here and ignore him. That’s what ignoring is. This is why I try to say to people the impact of the word is the almost lost to us of the word ignorance because of the way it’s pronounced. I tell people “start pronouncing it ignore-ance, ignor-ance,” then people will hear the word “ignore” in it and the connotation becomes clear. It means you’re ignoring it. Ignor- ance, that’s how I like to say it now, because the connotation is clear that way. The information is there, the truth is there, and somebody wants to ignore it completely. Now that is inexcusable and there is blame attached with that.


### Part 22
So what I ask people all the time is, “do we have a nescient society or do we have an ignorant one- do we have an ignore-ant one?” Is our society ensconced in nescience or is it ensconced in ignore-ance? I would argue, absolutely that we are ensconced in ignore-ance in society, not nescience. I think we are drowning in information, I think we are drowning in the truth that is all around us, but people are ignoring it, largely. Not everyone because many people are very hungry for it and taking it in as fast as they can. But I think the majority of human beings are in the state of ignore-ance, even though the truth is present all around us, and that constitutes what Art (Capozzi) talked about earlier, this consensus trance, which people in the so-called truth community or truth movement have likened to sleep. They say that they are asleep. I liken it to hypnosis. If you look at the origins of the word hypnosis, it means suppressed knowledge. It comes from Greek: hypo means under, as in hypodermic, under the skin, and gnosis means knowledge, the suppression of knowledge. Hypo means suppression also, under and suppression. So, hypnosis is the suppression of knowledge, and that’s the state that these people are in (referring to the slide). It’s done by themselves, see we have to stop looking at this as victim, as a victim relationship. This is a willful choice. In a time of overwhelming information available at people’s fingertips, the truth being ignored is not an option. It’s a willful decision that people are making and it’s a decision that they should be held accountable to because of what is going on that they are ignoring, what they are allowing to go on in their name and not saying a thing about it, content to let evil run amuck.


### Part 23
And then people will wonder “why are we losing freedom, why is freedom on the wane, why is totalitarianism and tyranny rising up, why do we see so much control and obsession with control in our society?”


### Part 24
They’ll see that, many of them will see the rising of the police state, they’ll see the injustices in our society, they’ll see the restrictions on our inherent natural liberty. but here’s the thing many of them will not make the transition to grasping.


### Part 25
They’ll say “yea, this is what’s happening to the earth, it’s being turned into a huge prison, everywhere,” and at the most rapid pace right here in America. And they’ll see this lock going onto the cage but the question that they never get to, they don’t even get to the question let alone the answer, is why.

### Part 26
They’ll talk about the symptoms, they’ll describe the prison, they’ll describe every corner of the cage, accurately in many cases. They could tell you exactly how it’s working. They could tell you all the different aspects of the control system, but they can’t tell you why it’s actually going into place, why is that happening. Well that’s what this presentation answers: why are we losing freedom, and it gets to the actual heart of that answer.


### Part 27
What this presentation constitutes is a master key that unlocks all the locks to all the doors on all the cages in the prison, if it is accepted. And once again, I don’t tell you to that belief is required for that, because truth is always present, it’s always here. it’s a matter of will we perceive it as being present, acknowledge it’s present by stop ignoring it, and then accept it into ourselves and then do something with it. understanding is not the end. Taking in the knowledge and understanding it is the beginning. Action is required. See, knowledge is required, understanding is required, but then action is finally required, above all, if change is to be created. And that’s how the laws of attraction really work.
