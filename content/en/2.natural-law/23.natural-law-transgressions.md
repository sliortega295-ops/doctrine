title: Natural Law Transgressions
description: The five most harmful actions under Natural Law
---

## Murder & Assault
Ending a life without the right to do so. If a being is killed in the act of somebody defending themselves, it is not murder.
Under no possible circumstance does the “right to murder” or the “right to assault” exist. However, the right to defend oneself through physical force exists at all times.

## Rape
Coercing the free will of another person, and making them sexually associate with whom they wish not to.

## Theft
Taking what somebody else has created or acquired through lawful means, which is their property for as long as they are using it and being responsible for it. You have no right to just take something that does not belong to you.

## Trespass
Every person has the right to set aside a (reasonably sized) space for themselves. And invading this area without permission or consent would be invading their privacy and their personal space, while taking away their security in the process.

## Coercion
Forcing somebody through threat of violence to have their will comply with yours, whether they wish that to be the case or not. Making somebody do something against their will is not a right. Although this is already a short and seemingly simple list, all these transgressions can ultimately be narrowed down to just one wrong-doing: Theft.

::note
Every harmful action that a person is capable of taking is a form of theft. Some form of property is always being stolen when a wrong-doing is committed.

## Property Types
- Life is a form of property.
- Rights are a form of property.
- Freedom is a form of property.
- A person's own body is a form of property.

## No Victim, No Crime

A living being or their property must have been harmed or damaged in order for a violation of Natural Law, or a wrong-doing to have taken place. Any action which does not cause such harm to other sentient beings is a right. - No victim, no crime. This is the fundamental crux of Natural Law; what is right behavior, and what is wrong behavior.

## No Delegation

There is no such thing as the delegation of a wrong-doing. In other words, if a specific action is not a right for any individual, then that action cannot be "delegated", "granted", or "licensed" to any other individual, or group of individuals, and suddenly be called a right. That action forever remains wrong under Natural Law.

::tip
Rights can't be granted to human beings by other human beings, because rights don't come from human beings.
::

## Equal Rights
Everybody is born with the exact same rights. Natural Law (the difference between right and wrong behavior) always holds true regardless of a population's belief systems (culture). This means that it doesn't matter how many people agree that a wrong action can be turned into a right action, or that a right action can be turned into a wrong action.

Such things can never be done in reality. People can only believe they can claim such reversals and that this will in some way make it so. Unfortunately, at this moment in time most people do erroneously believe that it is morally possible for some groups of people to create and delegate "rights" which do not exist, or to take away rights which do exist.

## A World with Only Two People
When in doubt as to whether an action is, or is not in harmony with Natural Law, visualize the scenario of a world with only two people.

If the behavior is a right or a wrong in that instance, it shall forever remain a right or a wrong in any size population, regardless of how many people may believe otherwise. So, if the action is a right for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a right. And if the action is a wrong for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a wrong, regardless of the number of people involved.

## Transcript

### Part 144
So, what we're gonna do is apophasis. We're going to do apophatic inquiry regarding Right and Wrong. So, what is not a Right? What are ways that people can cause harm to other people or animals? Ways that we can cause harm to other sentient beings. What we're doing here, we're going to list the boundary conditions for Natural law here, for breaking Natural Law. If we take these actions, we are breaking Natural law because the action is a cause, which results in the effect of harm to another being. so these are simply, what I call them, the Natural Law transgressions, which means sins or Wrongdoings, they're simply harmful actions that a person is capable of taking to another being, against another being. That's all. So, of course many people will get the first one. What's one of the main horrible Wrong things that someone can do to another person?

Kill them, murder them. Take their life. Murder. And I would distinguish murder from killing as well because occasionally to defend oneself, killing may be necessary. But murder is always immoral and Wrong.
see, the 5th (actually the 6th) commandment in Hebrew, do you know what it says in hebrew? It does not say “Thou shall not kill.” The term for murder is Hebrew is tir tsash. The 5th (actually the 6th) commandment in Hebrew is lo tir tsach , which means do not murder. Murder as a verb in Hebrew is a completely different word and a totally different connotation than the verb “to kill.” Because what they are saying is: “Don't take life without any Right to take it,” meaning that you initiated the violence. And that's what murder is: it's the initiation of the taking of someone else's life when you had absolutely no Right to take that life. Now, if someone is coming after you, your Rights, there may be times when you do have to take defensive action and forceful action up to and including deadly force. We're gonna talk about that later.
but murder is the 1st Natural Law transgression, and if you want to go down to a subsection of this transgression, you could list it as a totally separate Wrongdoing, I'm keeping it in the same basic category. Assault meaning you're directly physically accosting without Right, the wellbeing, the bodily wellbeing of another being is also, it's like, you could consider it attempted murder because assault is something you do without right. If someone assaults somebody, they have no Right to commit assault, it never exists, the Right to commit assault does not exist, the Right to murder does not exist in any circumstance ever. Blanket statement. The Right to defend oneself through physical force exists and possibly in certain circumstances the Right to kill exists, but murder and assault can never be Rights because they always are done by being initiated without the right to do so, it is the initiation of violence.

Rape is the 2nd Natural Law transgression. You're coercing the free will of another person and making them sexually associate with whom they wish not to. that's rape, and it's always Wrong. Blanket statement.

The 3rd Natural Law transgression is theft; it is the taking of property that does not belong to you. Someone else got that property through lawful means, without hurting somebody else, that's their property for as long as they are using it and being responsible for it. And you don't have a Right to take what doesn't belong to you. nobody has a Right to take my projector or my remote control or my computer any more than I would have the Right to take Richard’s cameras. That would be theft of somebody else’s property; it's not mine. And this is the problem, we don't understand property. As we're going to get to, all Rights are property Rights. We'll get to that in a moment. That's the 3rd Natural Law transgression.

The 4th is trespass. That means to going into somebody else's lair that they are using, that they own lawfully, and they are responsible for, without their permission or consent. And you're just invading their privacy and their space, and you're taking away their security from them in that process. We do have a Right to set aside a place for ourselves for our own lair and to violate that is to trespass against somebody else in their own property.

The 5th and last Natural Law transgression is coercion; this is forcing somebody through the threat of violence to have their will comply with your will whether they don't wish that to be the case or not. Making somebody do something that is against their will; coercing them. And that's also not a Right.
now, that's a small list, very small list, we could add one more, we could add lying, lying is also a Wrongdoing, and I would consider that a theft of truth or withholding of truth that somebody needs to understand and make accurate informed decisions; lying to them. essentially these 5 are the overarching Natural Law transgressions. I challenge anybody to come up with a Wrongdoing that doesn't fit into one of these categories. So far, I've never had one person able to do it. Any Wrongdoing, any action that you can think of that doesn't fall under one of these Wrongdoings. (Audience comments: voting) yeah, I would probably categorize it as pure ignorance, but you know, I would say, “Hey, maybe you could look at it like that because that's propagating the slavery system indirectly, so you're actually not doing anything to help anybody else's freedom certainly.” I don't know if I would categorize that as a Natural Law transgression because it's giving consent and propping up that system, it's not technically what I would call an action, but it's more of like giving consent. But hey, you could say that is a Wrongdoing I guess because giving your consent is tacitly saying yes to control and that's ultimately affecting everybody else's freedom negatively, so possibly.
but in general, what I would say is, if you can think of an actual physical action that doesn't fall on to one of those categories, so let me know because that's a pretty comprehensive list and it's only six words. Now what if I told you that I could narrow it
down? What if I told you I could get rid of 5 of those words? And take it down to 1?

These are the Wrongdoings. Let's try to narrow it down.

### Part 145
Every harmful action that a human being is capable of taking is a form of theft. Now many people will hear that for the first time, have never heard that said. there is no action that you can take that causes harm to another person that is not a form of theft in some form or fashion. I challenge anybody to come up with an action that isn't a form of theft, an action that is a Wrongdoing that isn't a form of theft; you won't be able to do it. I've put that challenge out on my podcast, saying email me if you know, not one person. The only person, one person, challenged it and tried to say lying. And I said okay, that's really taking the truth from somebody, thieving truth. Again, whether you want to look at it as you're simply dissuading them from looking at the truth too, deceiving them instead of not offering them correct information, still you're taking away their ability to make correct judgements based on the availability of information, so it is a form of theft.
some form of property, now look at that word, property, proper: meaning Right, is always being stolen when a Wrongdoing is committed. All Rights are property Rights; all Wrongs are theft of property. Once again, I challenge anybody; it's an open challenge if you can find me a Right that is not a property Right, or a Wrong that is not the theft of some form of property, please do it. Please let me know. Life is a form of property. So, taking life you had no Right to take, murder, is stealing property that wasn't your own, because that was that person’s life, possessive, they own it. And I didn't have a Right to just go and take it for no reason. Rights are a form of property, meaning actions that you may do because they are in harmony with Natural Law and do not cause harm to others, I don't have a Right to stop you from taking. If you're not harming somebody else, nobody has a Right to stop you from taking a Right, taking an action. You may perform any action which does not directly result in harm to somebody else. Rights are a form of property. Freedom is a form of property. Somebody doesn't have a Right to take somebody else's freedom and hold them against their will just because they don't like what they are doing, they have a distaste for what they are doing, or they want them to comply with their behavior, with their commands. They want them to make their behavior comply with the commands that they are being given.

### Part 144
So, if you really break it down, let's look at the Wrongdoings once again. murder, is that not the taking of someone else's life? Assault, is the taking of their Right to remain unharmed in their person; you're taking their health if you assault them, their homeostasis in their body is being put under assault. And that's robbery, that's somebody taking something that isn't theirs to take. Rape, you're taking somebody else's free will to sexually associate with whom they choose to sexually associate, and therefore that's a property theft because that's their property, that's their free will. Theft itself, it says it right there, you're taking physical possessions that aren't yours to take from somebody else, stealing. Trespass, you are taking someone’s security in their own lair, as we talked about, which you don't have a Right to take, that's also their property. Coercion, what are you taking? Somebody else's free will, which isn't yours to take, that's a gift from the
creator which belongs to each individual, and if somebody’s coercing somebody else by telling them “You must do this because I said so, and if you don't do this I will come and do some form of harm to you,” that's not a Right, that's a Wrongdoing, coercion. And it's a form of theft. (Comment from the audience) exactly, sure, “you must buy this,” imagine this. Great, we're gonna take 5 more minutes, and then we're going to take an hour and fifteen-minute break.

### Part 146
So, all of these things are forms of Wrongdoing, and they’re all ultimately one Wrongdoing in different forms; they are all theft, every one of them. There is only one Wrongdoing. There's only one way anybody can Wrong anybody else: stealing, that's it. Every form of Wrongdoing is a form of theft against another being and their property.

### Part 147
A living being or their property must have been harmed in order for a
violation of Natural Law or Wrongdoing to have taken place. Any action which does not cause such harm, is a Right. There's the apophatic definition of a Right, through understanding what a Wrongdoing is. And I'm telling you billions of people, not millions, not hundreds of millions; billions of people on this planet do not know this. could not tell you this, because this is it, this is it folks, right here, this is the crux of natural Law: what is a Right, what is a Wrong.
i couldn't sleep last night after we got home, and I never have a problem sleeping, ever, ever, and I'm just going to tell you this before we break. I was laying in bed, last night before we went to sleep for the night, could not sleep because all I was thinking of is how preposterous; I told this to some people at lunch, I'm just sitting there thinking about how preposterous and ridiculous it is for me to even ever have to utter any of this. The fact that this is not 100% pure common-sense knowledge on the earth is so abominably preposterous to me that all I was sitting there thinking is: how could I be going out and explaining this to people. This is what I must do? Me though! It was almost like schizophrenic in a way, because I was just thinking, I was waking up and then falling back to sleep and waking up thinking: where am I? Why am I here? And I'm the person who's coming out and doing this? And it's just so absurd and ridiculous to me, some punk from south Philadelphia, taking in the knowledge of the mystery traditions and teaching them to people. Me? It's the most ridiculous thing; I can't even imagine it. I still can't. I can't imagine that it's necessary.
that that's the position that our society is in. It's so profoundly sad that I can't believe it. and unless we deeply start to understand this and propagate this knowledge to other people, things are going to get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse. And there's no reason for it, there's no reason to go down that path. We want to choose the way of maximum pain because we don't want to give up thoughts that we're addicted to, just because the pattern has been there for as long as we can remember. We would rather go down the path to the grave and the abyss rather than admit we were Wrong, and just say
“I need to give up this negative way of thinking.”
i'm gonna leave it right there and just say the bottom line of what this section comes
down to is if someone hasn't been harmed, no Wrongdoing has been committed. No
victim no crime, in other words. Many people insist, “oh, there doesn't have to be a
victim for there to be a crime committed.” You know how many people are rotting away in a jail cell right now as we speak who have never harmed another living being? You know how many people? Tens of thousands. and no one has any Right to hold them. unless you've harmed somebody else, nobody has a Right to stop you from continuing to take the action that you are taking. We're gonna talk about some of those things in the last section, so let's take an hour and fifteen-minute break, and we'll be back here at about
5:20. pART 3

### Part 147
Okay, so we ended before the dinner break and I hope everybody enjoyed their dinner, at the concept that if there is no victim, if no actual Wrongdoing has taken place, resulting in harm to someone else, there is no crime. And many people are being jailed for victimless crimes that they've never actually harmed another being and yet their freedom has been taken away.

### Part 148
Another aspect about this concept of the difference between Right and wrong behavior is we have to understand that there is no such thing as the ability to delegate a Wrong to someone else. No one can say to someone: “You may harm him” unchallenged or unaccosted, that you're allowed to do that morally. No more than anybody can say a group of people may commit a Wrongdoing and they have the moral right to commit it, to commit that Wrongdoing, there's no such thing as that. This is what many people who believe in things like government believe in: that we can delegate to a group of people who are calling themselves a government, something that is not a right and agree, all come together and agree upon, they now possess this Right. Rights can't be granted by a human beings to other human beings; everybody is born with the same Rights because Rights don't come from human beings. Rights, like the Laws of nature, come from the creator of the universe; they don't come from human beings. human beings don't make up what Right and Wrong are. Right and Wrong are inherent to creation and are up to us to discover and recognize what they are, and then live in accordance with those principles.

so, if a specific action is not a Right for any individual, that action cannot be “delegated”, “granted”, or “licensed” to any other individual or group, and magically be called a right. It does not become a Right. If it’s a Wrong, then it remains a Wrong no matter how many people believe they can do it or delegate it or otherwise. Similarly enough, a right cannot be turned into a Wrong. If it's a Right, and you're not harming somebody by doing it, somebody can't magically say, “Well, that's a Wrong, and you're not allowed to do that.” And yet we have things that go right hand in hand with that, and it's called government. An action that is a Wrong will forever remain a Wrong under Natural Law.

### Part 149
So, how do we know what Rights are? Part of knowing Rights is understanding that Natural Law, the difference between Right and Wrong, always holds true regardless of a population's belief system. like Natural Law being in effect, the difference between Right and Wrong are not dependent on anybody's belief. They are eternal truths that need to be understood. So, this means that it does not matter how many people agree that a Wrong can be turned into a Right, or that a Right can be turned into a Wrong. Such things can never be done in reality. We can believe that we can do that and act like that, but in reality it cannot actually be done. A Right forever remains a Right a Wrong forever remains a Wrong. people can only believe they can claim such reversals, and that this will magically make it so. Unfortunately, most human beings erroneously believe that it is morally possible for them to create and delegate “Rights,” which do not exist, or to take away actual rights from people which do exist, they believe we can do that.

### Part 150
So, when in doubt whether an action is or is not in harmony with Natural law, the visualization exercise that I always ask people to do, is to imagine a scenario of a planet or world where there is only two people. Only two people exist on the entire planet. If the behavior in that circumstance, in that visualized instance, is either a Right or a Wrong in that instance, it remains a Right or a Wrong in any sized population regardless of how many people may believe otherwise. So, if a Right is a Right for one person to do toward another, or if it's a Wrong, the action is a Wrong for one person to take toward another, population is irrelevant. People will say, “well yeah, if there was a couple of people that would be okay, but in a world of 7 billion people, we can't let people do that.” Well this has nothing to do with what Right and Wrong is, as if they are changeable.
