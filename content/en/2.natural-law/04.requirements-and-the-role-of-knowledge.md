title: Requirements & the Role of Knowledge
description: Why Specific Understanding is the Non-Negotiable First Cause of Any Desired Effect
---

## Intro
People everywhere say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as a whole, such as happiness, health, peace, freedom, etc. Which of course, are all great things to aspire to, and most people will say that they want these things. However, it feels as though they aren't being completely honest with themselves, because when they are told that those aren't automatic conditions that manifest themselves, and that there are specific requirements for us to obtain these conditions, they usually don't want to hear about it. Also, people wouldn't say they want these conditions if they were already omnipresent. People say they want something because they don't already have it, whether it be partially, or in full.

## Requirements
This is what the real law of attraction is about; it explains that conditions of which you say you want them, don't automatically manifest by thinking of them, or just having a feeling about them. There are certain requirements for obtaining those conditions.
Of course, this statement only counts if you want something to be different than the way it already is; if you're completely okay with the way things are now, requirement doesn't exist.

## Knowledge
We need to know certain things. Knowledge that will ultimately lead us to positive action is
what's required. Specifically, the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining the conditions
we say we want. However, if this knowledge is absent it obviously can't be obtained and used
to create change. But if it is present, then it must be wilfully being ignored, and as long as this
knowledge continues to remain unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired
conditions will be impossible. And that is exactly what this guide is about; what those
requirements are, and what this knowledge consists of.

Human beings everywhere say that they want certain things in their life and they say they want certain things to be present for all humanity. We say we want certain conditions to be present for ourselves and our species as a whole and we say we want such things as happiness, health, peace, prosperity, freedom, etc. All these things are great things to aspire to, and we say we want them. Most people will say and tell you we want these things, however I don’t really feel that they’re truly being honest with themselves. They’ll say they want them, but then when you tell them, “well, those aren’t automatic conditions, they don’t just magically manifest.” There are requirements for obtaining these conditions and people wouldn’t say they want these conditions if these conditions were already omnipresent. They’re saying that they want something because they don’t have it, at all, or at least in fullness. So when you tell them there’s requirements for obtaining them, many people will say, “oh, well I may not be willing to go there, I may not want to exert that much effort,” and they believe that somehow they are going to magically get these things.

Well this is what the real laws of attraction are about; it’s explaining conditions that you want don’t just automatically manifest by thinking of them or just having a feeling about them, this is a new age deception. There are requirements for obtaining the conditions that we say we want. Requirements exist in nature. It does exist. If you want something to be different than the way that it already is, than the default conditions, then requirement exists. If you’re okay with things being the way they are now, requirement doesn’t exist, there are no requirements to creating change. You just accept the default conditions the way they are now and go on with your existence and accept it’s going to be this way and possibly get worse. But if you want real change to happen, requirements exist, and this is what many new age teachers will not tell you or they’ll outright deny that requirements exist for creating real change. Specific requirements exist in order for human beings to obtain the conditions that they say they want. If the requirements for obtaining those conditions are not met, those conditions do not just magically manifest, by magical means automatically. That’s not how it works folks and that bursts a lot of people’s bubble right off the bat. This is a key concept to understand.

So what are these requirements? We need to know certain things. knowledge is required. Knowledge, knowledge that will spur us to action, that’s what’s required. Since human beings, as a species, do not already have the things they say they want, and again, at least not in fullness. We want to split hairs, we can say we have a modicum of what we may say that we want, but we don’t have it in the fullness that we will say that we want it, especially societally, globally. So since we don’t already have these things, it follows logically that the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining these things either must be absent; the knowledge is not present anywhere, or if it is present, if that knowledge for obtaining those things, the requirements for obtaining those things, if that knowledge is present, then it must be willfully being ignored. It is here, and yet people aren’t paying attention to it, they aren’t taking it in and accepting it and doing anything with that knowledge. So they’re ignoring it because it’s uncomfortable. as long as this knowledge continues to remain either unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired conditions that we say that we want, is impossible. Can not happen. It is an impossibility for it to magically automatically manifest without the requirements being met. That’s what we’re going to talk about here today. What are these requirements? What is this knowledge?
