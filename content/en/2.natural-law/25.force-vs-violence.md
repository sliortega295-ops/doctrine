## Force
**The capacity to do work or cause physical change.** For any change to be created in the physical world in any capacity, physical force must be applied. There is nothing you can do to change something in the physical world, that doesn't require force. The words you are reading right now were typed out by hand using physical force.

::tip
Force is the capacity to perform physical work, physical change.
::

**Action which is in harmony with morality and Natural Law because it does not violate others' rights.** As soon as a person steps over that line, and uses initiation of force for coercive reasons or applications, that is what makes it violence instead of force. Force itself is not the same as violence.

**Action which one always possesses the right to take (including defense against violence).** When you are approached with violence you reserve the right to use physical force defensively against such an assault.

## Violence
**The immoral initiation of physical power to coerce, compel or restrain.** [Initiation](/en/reference/glossary#initiation) is the key-word here. Nobody ever has the right to enact violence; because violence is always starting the conflict.

::note
The immoral initiation of force is violence.
::

For example, what often happens in primary schools when two students get into a physical altercation, the teachers usually tend to say: "It doesn't matter who started it". While that is one of the absolute most critically important things that matters. Because the person that struck first, is the person that conducted violence, they initiated the immoral use of physical force.

**Coercive action which is in opposition to morality and Natural Law because it involves the violation of others' rights.** This is exactly why it's called violence; it violates the rights of other people. The act of violating rights is what violence is, it's derived from the same root word, the Latin verb **_Violare_**, which means "to Treat with violence or dishonor".

**Action which one never possesses the right to take.** There exists no such thing as the right to commit violence. However, one always reserves the right to use force in a defensive capacity, up to, and including deadly force.

### Part 155
FORCE VS. VIOLENCE
force versus violence. We need to understand that these concepts are complete opposites of each other. They are not the same. The term should never be used interchangeably with each other because not only are they not even remotely similar, they're direct diametrically opposed opposites.

### Part 156
Let's look at the difference; they're often spoken about as if they're the same, and they're used interchangeably, when in fact, they are actually diametrically opposed to each other.
force: the definition of force is the capacity to do work or cause physical change in the physical world. Okay? For any change to be created in the physical world in any capacity, force must be used and applied. There's nothing you can do that doesn't require force, if you're going to make a change happen in the physical. Okay, so to set up this equipment, force was required: we had to lift it, we had to set it up, we had to plug in the cables. Force is required to do all those things. It's the capacity to perform physical activity, physical work. Force is actually action with which is in harmony with morality and Natural Law because the taking of it, the usage of it doesn't violate Rights of other people.

so, as soon as you're stepping over the line into coercive usage of force, that becomes violence. The initiation of force for coercive reasons, for coercive applications becomes violence; that's what makes it violence. Force itself is not violence. As such, force is action, which one always possesses the natural Rights of take, and this includes the defense, the physical defense of someone's person, their body against the act of violence; force may be applied in that situation. When you are accosted with violence, you do reserve the Right to use physical force defensively against such an assault. Violence on the other hand, and this is the key to keep in mind with violence; it is the immoral initiation of physical power to coerce, compel, or restrain unrightfully. No one has the right to ever enact violence because violence is always starting it. Initiation, that's the keyword there. It's the immoral, the unrightful initiation.

so, you know, teachers in schools will, if there's a skirmish that happens between a couple of male students one day, they'll say “it doesn't matter who started it.” All that matters is who started it. All that matters is who started it. All that matters because the person who actually conducted violence is the person who struck first. They initiated the immoral use of physical behavior, of physical force: physical power to coerce, compel, or restrain. Therefore, when the person beats back that physical assault with force, they have not committed an additional Wrongdoing.

it's difficult for many people to understand who are in right-brained imbalance. They don't want to acknowledge that you maintain the Natural Right to use force when you are accosted and with violent behavior. If someone just came up to me on the street and started swinging because they want something I have or just because they don't like the look of me for whatever reason, they don't have the Right to do that. If I replied by beating back their attack with sufficient force to put that action down, how many wrongdoings would have been committed? (Audience response) one. correct. One, not two. One. Because I maintain the Right to defend myself with physical power, with physical force when necessary when violence, meaning someone else started the immoral behavior. That's what matters; the initiation. Who started it is all that matters. All that matters. And again, it's a very difficult thing for the ego to comprehend. The ego doesn't want to hear that. It's been conditioned so long that responding with force is also violence. We are verbally and mentally equating these two things, and when they are in fact, actual complete opposites.

if a kid got hit by somebody else in a school and then that other kid said, maybe even said once, “stop what you're doing,” and then when the other kid wouldn't stop, he punched him and knocked him out. I would ask other people “who struck first?” And if the kid lying on the floor struck first, I'd say “you got what you deserved.” That's it. Because that person had a Right to defend themselves. You had no Right to strike him. You initiated the violence, he responded with defensive force. Many people don't want to hear that because they're very conditioned and I'm not saying you have to do that. You also reserve the Right not to do that. But the Right does exist, both things, both Rights exist. You would have the Right to not respond with physical force, but you would have the Right to respond with physical force. See, that's a freewill decision that the person has the Right to choose between those actions.

i don't even look at either one of them as the high road. You know? Personally, I think if somebody keeps beating somebody and keeps conducting violence to them and the other person keeps accepting it and never rebels against it, never uses any force to put it down, i almost look at that as the low road. I'm not a pacifist. Not a pacifist, okay? I am 100% about nonviolence, meaning don't initiate harm to other people. Don't start it. “Don't start none, won't be none” in street lingo. That's how it really is, but if somebody else starts it, they're asking to be put down with the amount of physical force that is required to put down the act of aggression.

Violence is coercive action. See that's the key, it's always coercion: saying “you're going to do what I want you to do, or then I'm going to strike. Then I'm going to commit the act of violence.” It's coercive: it's action, which is always in opposition to morality and natural Law for the very reason that it involves the violation of others' Rights. That's why it's called violence. It's a vio-lation the act of violation, because it resulted in vio- lence, your Rights have been violated. That's why it's called violence. It's the same root word. Violence is actually which one never possesses the Right to take, ever. There is no such thing as the Right to commit violence, doesn't exist, because violence is the immoral initiation of physical power to compel, coerce restraint, which no one has the right to do. No, you don't have the Right. No, one does have the Right to initiate that type of action. Force on the other hand, there is a time and a place to exert that force in a defensive capacity. Alright, so we'll talk about that here.

### Part 157
This piece of trash comes up to somebody on the street and says, “give me all everything's valuable. I want your shoes. Oh, they're leather? Take them off. Take the wallet out, all the jewelry in your purse, in your wallet.” It's called a thug. Nobody would believe he has the authority or the Right to do that, and we would have the moral obligation to obey this criminal. If the criminal started calling himself government, we might start believing it, right? But let's say, somebody on the street saw what was being done, took out their own nine millimeter, and blew this guy away. How many acts of violence were committed? One. One.

### Part 158
(Audience comments: “But they wouldn’t look at it like that”) well I understand, but again, that's somebody saying, “I prefer not to see it that way.” Again, perception and reality do not really align in many cases, they're not the same. That person is incorrectly perceiving what is. They're not seeing the truth, and many people don't want to hear that that's the truth because they're very conditioned, and they are very well-behaved slaves. You know, as harsh as that is to say. They don't want to understand that the inherent Right to use force against violence exists and is always our right, always. Now, I'm not telling you to go out immediately and do that either because the perception is so screwed up, and the body of humanity that the majority of people don't believe that would be a Right and they'll persecute you for doing it. You see, the self-defense principle is continuously being eroded.

human beings possess the Natural Right to defend themselves from violence with defensive physical force. A person who is accosted by violence possesses the Right to stop the person who is conducting the violence from continuing to do harm to them with any amount of force that is necessary to stop the attack or the assault; up to and including deadly force. I would say too, if you want to be nice about it, give the person one verbal warning to stop; say no once, after that it's on. That's it. And that's really my policy. and that would be my policy on the street with an individual. The problem is here, the so-called “authorities” of the government, like you say, don't want to see it that way and they're constantly trying to take this Right away from somebody. They're constantly trying to say, “no, we own the monopoly on the usage of force, and all you may do is wait and be accosted and assaulted until one of us shows up.” Well, you know what that's called? It's called a big crock of bullshit, is what that's called, and it shouldn't be accepted by anyone who has any common sense, shouldn't be accepted by anyone. unfortunately, again, like I said, people are very, very well conditioned and they think that this is an example of two Wrongs don't make a Right. There’s no two Wrongs committed there. There's one Wrong committed, and then there's a Right that is being exercised. Big difference between exercising a Right that involves the defensive use of force, and committing a Wrongdoing, which involves the initiation of violence. And people gotta get clear on this. They have to get clear on it.

### Part 159
So, the question becomes, does violence magically become a Right when it's conducted by Government? When they shut down people's free speech Rights and assembly Rights. Or when they conduct direct theft from people through this euphemized form of slavery called taxation? And like I said, I'm not asking you to accept or believe taxation is slavery. I'm telling you, if you don't understand that, you're Wrong. i don't care what you think, I'm telling you it is that way in truth and in reality: taxation, slavery, shutting down a people's Rights is slavery. Telling people what they may or may not put in their body is slavery. It's not my perception. That's what is, okay, and that's what we're accepting as a people. We're accepting that. These people have no more right to do it than any other individual would.
