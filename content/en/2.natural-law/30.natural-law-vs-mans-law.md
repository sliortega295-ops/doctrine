## Natural Law

**Based upon principles & truth**.  
Inherent to creation. Things that are inherent to creation are not made or caused by humankind.

**Harmonized with, due to knowledge & understanding. (or rejected, due to ignorance or contradicting beliefs).**  
Natural Law isn't something that's based on a person's compliance, because that person has to fear the “punishment” of not understanding it. If you don't understand it, and don't live according to it, the result or consequence will be inescapable.

If you behave a certain way, there are certain consequences. And if you change your
behavior, you'll change the consequential results.

### Universal
Exists and applies anywhere in the universe regardless of location. There is no place you can go in the physical universe where Natural Law doesn't apply.

### Eternal and immutable.
Exists and applies for as long as the universe exists, and cannot be changed. Natural Law is immutable because it cannot be changed by any action that any being in the universe is capable of taking.

## Man's Law (Government)

### Dogmatic
Based upon dogmatic beliefs. (Constructs of mind). These beliefs can be seen as “programs” operating in the human mind.

### Fear Based
Complied with due to fear of punishment. Fear is usually the only reason people ever comply with the law of man; and fear is an extremely low state of consciousness.

### Location Based Moral Relativism
Differs with location based upon the whim of legislators. For example, prohibition; you are "allowed" to smoke marijuana in certain countries, but could be jailed for doing the exact same thing in another country where it's deemed "illegal".

### Time Based Moral Relativism
Changes with time based upon the whim of legislators. To use prohibition as an example again; from 1920 until 1933, it was made illegal to possess, and to consume alcohol in the United States of America. Before 1920 it was legal, and after 1933 it was made legal again, all because of what some politicians wrote on pieces of paper.

For man's law this means; if a particular man-made law is in harmony with Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is redundant, since it is stating a truth that is pre-existing and inherent in Nature. Therefore, the writing down of that concept and calling it a law, is both unnecessary and irrelevant.

If a particular man-made law is in opposition to Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is both false (incorrect) and immoral (harmful to others), more simply put, it's wrong. Because if it isn't based in Natural Law it means that it is causing somebody harm by taking something that belongs to them, whether it's a right, or any physical possession. Therefore, it can never be legitimately binding upon anyone. Somebody can't write down a wrong-doing and tell you that it is morally binding upon you, while simultaneously literally stating that even though it causes harm, you must obey this rule.

::tip
In light and presence of Natural Law, man's “law” is always unnecessary and irrelevant.

## Transcript

### Part 176
natural Law versus Man's law or Government.

### Part 177
Here's the differences. Natural Law is based upon Principles and Truth, meaning things that are inherent to creation are not made by humankind. Natural Law can only either be harmonized with, due to knowledge and understanding, or rejected due to ignorance. So, it's not something that is based on compliance because of we fear the punishment that would result in not understanding it. If you don't understand it and live according to it, the result is inescapable because men and women are not actually creating the result. The universe is bringing that result to us intelligently and dynamically. In other words, once again, this is about consequences: you behave a certain way, there's certain consequences; you change the behavior, you'll change the consequential results. natural Law is universal, which means that it exists and applies anywhere in the universe regardless of physical location. There is no place you can go in the physical universe to escape Natural Law. Let me know if you find a way out of this universe and into another, where Natural Law no longer applies and, you know, we'll take a look at it together. But, until you figure out the way out of this universe and into a place that's not governed by law, you're bound by Natural Law. Natural Law is eternal. It will exist for as long as the universe exists and it is immutable; exists and applies for as long as the universe exists, and can not be changed by anything humanity is capable of doing or any other species in the universe is capable of doing for that matter.

man's law on the other hand, let's look at how this contrasts with Natural Law. It's not based on Principles and Truth; it's based on dogmatic beliefs that are programs that are running in the human mind. These are constructs of the mind that operate like programs. man's law is complied with due to the fear of the punishment that will be conducted upon people who attempt to not comply with it. It's most of the only reason people ever comply with the law of man, and that's a very low state of consciousness: fear. That really is only going to get you all the negative things that we say we don't want, if we're in that vibration. Man's law differs with location based upon the whim of legislators, like prohibition. Well, I'm allowed to smoke marijuana in one state, and then I could be jailed for it in another. My freedom can be taken if I cross this imaginary line? Hey, I'm a gun owner. If take certain weapons that I own across an imaginary line, I can be jailed for years, but over this side of the imaginary line, it's okay, and you're just exercising a right. Over here, it's morally Wrong; “We'll cage you for it.” Over here, yeah, “you're allowed to do that, you can have that high capacity magazine,” but over here, “you're going into a cage for it,” just by crossing an imaginary barrier called a state border. And people think that makes sense. They think the moral relativism of man's law makes sense. They actually believe something can be moral in one place and immoral in another place. You know, that's cognitive dissonance: that's holding two contradictory notions in the mind simultaneously and accepting them both when they're clear contradictions with each other. It's called lying to yourself. Let's be honest about what it really is, it's called lying yourself.

man's law changes with time, based upon the whim of legislators, which is also moral relativism. Prohibition in the 1920s: it was legal to possess and consume alcohol, then for years it became illegal to do so, then it switched back to becoming magically moral again. We won't cage you for doing it, all changes over time based on what our preferences and likes and dislikes. Yeah, we get to make up what law is, what Right and wrong are. It's called moral relativism alight. And it's one of the tenants of satanism.

### Part 178
So, what does this mean for the law of man, actually? That people seem to have so much respect for, you know, we're a nation of laws written by men. “We don't give a damn about moral law. We don't really give a damn about what's Right and wrong, but we have so much respect for the law of man.” Which people actually believe is somehow based in morality when it's nothing of the kind; couldn't get any further from the truth, in that it's based in moral relativism, which is about the whims of the legislator at any given time or place. You can listen to certain forms of music in certain countries in the Middle East; you could be jailed for years just by putting a certain song on. imagine this, and we would think that's unacceptable and deplorable. Yet we think “you have this 30 round magazine here, this state only allows 10 cartridges to go into a magazine.” I bring the physical object, even if it's not loaded with any ammunition into another state, I can be put in a cage, for a physical piece of plastic. You know, it's total nonsense. Either something is a Right, and you're allowed to own it, and you need to be responsible for it, or it's not a Right because you're harming somebody, you know, it doesn't get any simpler than that. So, what's this all mean for man's law in light of natural Law, what does it mean? To understand Natural law, what does that mean for the laws of man here on earth?

### Part 179
What it actually means, it’s simple if/then logic to apply. If a particular manmade law is in harmony with Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is redundant. It is stating the obvious; it is the stating what is already known. It's like saying, “I'm going to write down yes, during the day, the sky refracts a blue frequency, the sky is blue, I'm gonna write that down and make it so.” It's redundant. It's self- evident. You can go out into the sky and look at the natural color of the sky on a clear day and see what the frequency is with your own eyes. No, you don't need to have it written down, okay? It's a redundancy. So, if it's in harmony already with Natural Law, it's stating a Truth that is already there. It's an inherent truth. It's preexisting, it's self- evident. Therefore, the writing down of that concept and calling it a law is irrelevant and unnecessary.

now let's look at the opposite. What if something that man writes down as a law is in direct opposition to Natural Law? So, if a particular manmade law is in opposition to natural Law, it follows logically that it is both false, meaning that it is incorrect. That's what Natural Law is, it's based in Truth, that which is. And it's also immoral (opposing manmade laws) because if it's not based in Natural Law, it means that it is doing something that is actually harming somebody by taking something from them that doesn't belong to you. Like taxation, like permits and licensing, like suspending Rights that do already exist, et cetera, so forth. So, therefore it's Wrong, and it cannot be legitimately binding upon anyone. You can't write down a Wrong and say this is morally binding upon you, even though it creates harm. It causes harm, yet you must follow it. You know, and people believe this. We asked in the Natural Law seminar: how many people believe that if a law is passed and it restricts a Right that you feel you have naturally because that action that it's saying you may not do causes no one else any harm? You have any moral obligation to obey that law until you could find a way to get it changed? and over two-thirds of people said yes, you have a moral obligation to obey that law because these people have the moral right to issue commands and write down laws that constrain you, even if that behavior actually doesn't harm anybody and therefore is a natural Right, you would still have to try to find a way to get that law changed. nonsense. Nonsense. No one can be legitimately bound to a dictate of man that prevents somebody from exercising a Natural Right. It's called mind control, is what it's called.

### Part 180
So, in light of the differences between man's law and Natural Law.

### Part 181
In light of Natural Law, man's law is both irrelevant and unnecessary as it is either redundant, because it is in harmony with Natural Law, or it is completely immoral because it is in direct opposition to Natural Law.
