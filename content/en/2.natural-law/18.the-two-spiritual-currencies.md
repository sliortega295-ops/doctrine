title: The Two Spiritual Currencies
description: Time and Attention, our two Spiritual Currencies. This analogy can be seen very readily in the sayings "spending time" and "paying attention".

Whatever information or endeavors we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting
something in return for that investment. This return could come in the form of knowledge,
understanding, skills, or expertise. However, this only happens if we invest our spiritual
currencies wisely. We should seek to improve the quality of our attention by directing it
towards information that is capable of improving both our own lives, as well as the human
condition as a whole.

Such an effort would constitute a valuable investment of our time. We should more frequently ask ourselves the questions:

**“What am I spending my time on?**

**What am I paying attention to?”**

And most importantly,

**“What kind of quality am I getting in return for these investments of my spiritual currencies?"**

## Transcript

### Part 89
This next section I call spiritual currency or spiritual currencies.

### Part 90
There’s two spiritual currencies: time and attention. Now, look, we can readily see this right; “time is money,” people say. It’s currency, right? What am I going to spend my time on? What am I going to pay attention to? You pay attention. You pay for something; you get something in return when you pay for something. That’s what attention will get you here in return. You pay attention, you’re gonna come out of here with some understanding.

### Part 91
There’s two spiritual currencies: time and attention. This analogy can be seen
very readily in the sayings “spending time” and “paying attention.” Whatever information or endeavors we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting something in return for that investment of these currencies. This is what real money is folks, real money; this will get you real mon - ey, one eye, mon - eye. You want real money instead of the fake federal reserve nonsense, fiat paper currency money that it isn’t worth the paper it’s printed upon, then keep thinking that that has value.

And people will say gold is valuable, gold is real money. Yeah, well, I ask people, “what intrinsic value does gold have?” And they say, “oh, it’s been traded throughout time immemorial, people valued it all the time.” Does that make it intrinsic? That’s like saying, why does the projector have intrinsic value? And you say, because I find it valuable. No, that projector has intrinsic value because it’s capable of projecting an image, and if I want that task done, that’s what I use a projector for. Well, what’s gold used for? Can you build clothing out of it? Can you build a house out of it? Is it malleable enough to be molded into a weapon of some sort? You gonna take shelter under it? Maybe if you have enough of it. The whole point is that there is no intrinsic value to this, the idea of any precious metal having intrinsic value other than, okay, in a technological society it is used for computers, this is true, but I’m talking about in nature. where would this idea of intrinsic value come of gold come from in the ancient past? people will say “oh it’s used as a medium of exchange.” Money is not a medium of exchange. People think of it as a medium of exchange and it’s not, it’s incorrect. Money is the limiter of energy in the system. See, people think of money as currency, even in the name is a mind-control technique. Because it’s supposed to be about “it’s the current in the energy system, this is the current; it’s the amperage.” Right? No, it’s not. It’s not the capacitance either. It’s not a store. That’s another thing people will tell you money is, what they say is “real money.” It’s all fake, it’s all fake. It’s not a store either, you know what it is? It’s the resistance in the system. It’s the resistance to change in the system. It acts as the resister because as long as that modality of slavery called money continues to exist, it will always be extraordinarily difficult to create real lasting change. again, I piss off everybody. Religion’s gotta go, scientism’s gotta go, new age thought’s gotta go, money’s gotta go. All of it’s gotta go. You know why? It’s all religion. It’s all religion and the word religion means to hold one back, to tie one up and keep them where they’re at, as we’re gonna get to in a few moments.

let’s get back to spiritual currencies. We end up getting something in return on what we invest our spiritual currencies toward, and you what that, if it’s put toward the right goals, the end result is true money, one eye (third eye). True spiritual vision, the ability to see, to un-occult something and see it for what it really is. That’s what comes from truly putting time and attention onto the right things. This return could come in the form of knowledge; it could come in the form of understanding; it could come in the form of skills, expertise and empowerment, but only if we invest these two spiritual currencies wisely. And let me tell you something folks, that's why most people don't have any money, they got nothing to pay for it with. See, you pay attention and you get money, you spend time and you get money. I'm talking about the real thing. Cool, we're gonna take a break in about 5 to 10 minutes. so, we have to invest our spiritual currencies wisely.

### Part 92
We should seek to improve our quality of attention by placing it upon information that is capable of improving both ourselves, and the human condition as a whole. Give me a heads up in about 8 or 9 minutes, thank you (speaking to the manager). such an effort would also constitute a valuable investment of our time.
we should ask ourselves “what am I spending my time on? What am I spending my time doing and what am I paying attention to?” That's where you will find whether you are investing in real value, something that is truly valuable. If most of the time we're
spending our time on nonsense and trivialities, and divisive things and TV and sports and all other kinds of entertainment and distraction, well you're gonna have a return on that investment. And that return is gonna be low; it's not gonna result in much money
(pointing to the third eye). Real money. Most importantly, we need to ask ourselves,
“what kind of quality am I getting in return for my investments of time and attention?” these are the spiritual currencies, and that's what most people don't want to give. They don't want to give these freely for a return on investment. They don't want to pay attention to the right things, they don't want to spend time on the right things.

### Part 93
This is a simple chart of how our quality of our attention, and again this is in the aggregate but it's created by all of the individuals: how the quality of our overall attention as a species will affect our world in accordance with the Principle of correspondence. Which states; as goes the microcosm, or the microcosmic units, so will become the macrocosm.
so, over here, we have a pure information stream, this is good information. This is information that resonates with truth, and is capable of helping to develop wisdom or right action within the being. This over here, is the poisoned information stream, which we get from the mainstream media, from scientism, from the new age movement, from government indoctrination centers called schools. This is the poisoned information stream. Now, everybody is gonna take in some form of a mixture of both of these streams. What the goal needs to be, is to purify. Just like “Hey, you take in bad food, you're gonna have bad health.” You take in bad information, the output through behavior is gonna be bad. So you gotta purify, meaning if there’s valves here on the individual buckets: these are called the individual people, and they're all coming together with the quality of their water, what they're holding within their consciousness, and that's all going into the big pool called the world. Everybody's bringing their bucket to the pool, they're pouring it in, and then they're jumping in. And that's the world, that's the quality of the world. The quality of this whole thing here is gonna be based on how much poisoned, polluted information was in your bucket compared to how much pure information was in your bucket.
so, there’s valves over here, we gotta shut this one off: this brown muddy valve over here. And we gotta open this one up (the pure valve). If we do that, the world will be purified. And we won't be creating self-inflicted suffering. We don't do that; we're gonna be swimming in brown muck and generating all kinds of problems for ourselves.

### Part 94
So, how are we spending our time? What are we paying attention to? Is this what we're doing with our time and attention? Sitting behind the hypnosis box? Which means suppression of knowledge. Hypnosis is the suppression of knowledge or the suppression of spirit.

### Part 95
Or, are we going to devote our time to some pursuits of wisdom? Which means: developing knowledge, converting it into understanding by processing it accurately, and then converting it into wisdom through action, through Right action.
you gotta read to do this. People don't want to hear that either. Reading is required. The ancient Romans had 2 words that were the same word that meant 2 different things in their language; the word was liber. L-I-B-E-R. Liber meant free, as in not a slave. A free being would be described as liber , free. It's the basis of the English word: liberty. liber - ty, liberty, freedom. They had the same word also meant another concept. So, the word liber didn't just mean free, if it was used in a different context, does anyone know what else the word liber meant? L-I-B-E-R meant in Latin? Book. It meant Book. Does that tell us something? They associated the Latin word for book, also meant free in their language. And again, liber is the basis for the word library_. Liber_ - ary. Where you can go to become free if you read the right books. And again, the world is our library now, we've reunited all the parts of the big library that were cast to the 4 corners of the earth. the mystery traditions are available at your fingertips now. Which hasn't been the case at any time in human history, and what are we doing? We're playing FarmVille on facebook.
so, we have to ask ourselves, what are we spending our spiritual currency on, and are we investing it wisely? For a return of real money, which is actually spiritual enlightenment. i'm gonna take a quick break right there, and we'll pick it up with the next section in 10 minutes, 10 minutes, right back here to continue. Thank you.
