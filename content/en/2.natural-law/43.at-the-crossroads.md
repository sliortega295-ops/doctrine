## Post Apocalyptic Era
We are living in 'Post-Apocalyptic' times, in the literal sense of the word. The word 'Apocalypse' is derived from the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek verb 'Calyptein (καλυπτειν)' which means 'to Cover / to Conceal,' hence the word apocalypse literally means 'to Reveal' or 'to Take out of hiding.' Therefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been lifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out there, and available for most people to find.

## The Cosmic Apology
We have to make, what has been called "The Cosmic Apology". The word 'Apology' is made up of the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek noun 'Logos (λόγος)' which means 'Word.' Hence apology literally means 'to Go away from the word' (to take back something you said), or 'to Give back the word.' If a person says something they didn't really mean, or something they want to retract, they apologize; they are “moving away from” what they have said.

The Greek noun 'Logos' is derived from the Greek verb 'Lego (λεγω)' which means 'to Speak / to Say' (this is where the English word 'Lexicon' comes from). The Latin noun 'Lex / Legis (Law)' is also derived from this same Greek verb. God, not man, is the author (authority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence.

Humanity's work is to learn to listen to God's word, which is, Natural Law, spiritual law, moral law, God's law; and to align its behavior to that law.

Humanity must make this Cosmic Apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to God, and collectively aligning its behavior with Natural Law. This is accomplished when we open our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word 'No' to those who claim to be our owners.

The very beginning of this guide started out with the chapter ["Before we begin"](/en/natural-law/before-we-begin).

AT THE CROSSROADS
at the crossroads: this is the last section, then we’ll get to some questions.

#### Slide 269
Quote by R. Buckminster Fuller: “The dark ages still reign over all humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. this Dark Ages prison has no steel bars, no chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by mis- orientation and built upon mis-information. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt meagerly to compete with God. All are intractably skeptical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these Dark Ages simply by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think.” The conditioning of our thought is what has kept us in this prison. and only now, the actual depths of the dark ages that we are in are starting to become clear to some people.


#### Slide 270
We are in the time that I call the apocalypse and actually I want to start rephrasing this; I want to actually explain to people we’re not in the apocalypse anymore. we are now in post-apocalyptic times. We are living in post-apocalypse. The apocalypse has already occurred. It’s over. We are living in the time after the apocalypse, and what do I mean by that? Well, we got to look at the meaning of the
word: from the Greek prefix apo , which means away from, off of, or removed from. And then the Greek verb calyptein , which means to cover, or to conceal, or to hide. So, apocalypse means literally: to take the cover off of, to remove the veil from, or to take something out of hiding. Well ladies and gentlemen, another big surprise, the veil has already been lifted. The truth is already out there. It’s out. The truth about what’s going on here and has been going on here on the earth is out. It has been de-occulted, not just by me, but by many many other researchers. There’s a laundry list of them on my website I talk about in the podcasts. It’s all out there. It literally means to reveal or take out of hiding. The apocalypse is the great revealing of the truth to the masses of people.


#### Slide 271
Or, it is what I simply refer to as the process of de-occulting the truth: removing it from being hidden.


#### Slide 272
What humanity needs to do is make what I call the cosmic apology, and I’ll get to what that means. See these words right here: “I was Wrong.” That’s the most powerful phrase that can ever be said by a human being. The second most powerful phrase I would acknowledge is “I love you,” but this is more powerful than even that because this is about internal change, not just a dynamic where an interaction or a relationship with another, this is about an internal metamorphosis. When you say these words (I was Wrong), this is the phrase of all power. “No” is the word of all power by which we reclaim our power, but this is the phrase of power. The word apology comes from Greek: apo , meaning away from or off of, or removed from as we’ve just seen, and the Greek noun logos. Logos means word. So hence, an apology, it literally means to go away from the word, or to give back the word. You are taking it back. So if I make an apology, I said something I really didn’t mean it or I want to retract it, an apology means, let me take back what I just said. I’m taking it back, I’m removing the word. I’m going away from the former word or phrase that I just said. That’s an apology in standard colloquial English understanding sentence.


#### Slide 273
Let’s look at what I call the Cosmic Apology, where this term really comes from, what it really means. See the Greek noun logos , which is written there in Greek script, which means word in Greek; it comes from the Greek verb lego. Lego in Greek means to speak or to say. It’s where we get the English word lexicon from. The Latin noun lex , legis is related to the Greek verb lego , to say. Again, because who put the laws into manifestation? The creator did. How did the creator manifest the physical universe and all the laws? Spoke it into existence. Reality and truth are spoken into existence by the power of vibration, the vibratory power of voice. So the creator created the universe by the phrase: fiat lux in Latin means let there be light. The Latin noun lex , legis meaning law is actually derived from this Greek verb lego meaning to speak or to say. god, and not man, is the logos, the author of Law. The one who spoke the law into existence at the creation of the universe because Natural Law is the boundary conditions of the manifested reality called the physical universe. These are the boundary conditions which govern it. Humanity’s work is to learn to listen to god’s word, not man’s word, not man’s law, Natural Law, Spiritual Law, Moral Law, God’s Law, Karmic Law, I don’t care what you want to call it. Call it whatever you want. Consequentialism. This is the truth. You want to talk about what all these phrases really mean? It all comes back to the
word Truth, that’s it. It’s the truth about what is. What’s operating here, and humanity needs to align its behavior to this law: God’s Law, Natural Law. Without alignment of its behavior to Natural Law, don’t expect a thing to change here. Expect it to get rapidly grow worse.


#### Slide 274
Humanity must make a cosmic apology by giving to word, which means the authorship of creating law. See we think we’re the authors, we’re he authorities. It’s what author means right? Author. What’s another word for author? This is how mind control through words works: an author is a what? A writer. Well what are you saying there? An author who has author-i-ty, they are authoring something, is a right-er; they are a right: R-I-G-H-T-E-R. They’re making it into a Right. This is what you hear when you hear the word authority. You hear author, which means a (writer) right-er, meaning one who makes Rights, which means someone who believes they’re god. That’s all this really comes down to. In a nutshell, we’re up against a class of people who believe that they can be god, and own and rule everybody else. That’s all the dark occult comes down to folks. People who believe they’re god, sick psychopathic lunatics who think they’re god, and are gonna rule the hell of the prison world that they are going to create called their dark new world order.
we need to give the word back, that’s what an apology is, and who it needs to be given back to is the creator of the universe, because that’s the author of the law. That’s its rightful owner. The word doesn’t belong to us, folks, the word belongs to god. That’s why it says at the beginning of the biblical texts: in the beginning was the word and the word was god. That’s what the logos is: Natural Law. God is law. You want the best definition I can give you for the word God? Law. People don’t want to look at it like that. Very few people ever look at it like that. That’s what the force of creation is, it’s natural Law. It’s how we co-create our reality, whether we do it consciously or unconsciously.


#### Slide 275
This apology is accomplished when we open our minds and hearts to truth and we start saying the lost word “no” to evil, to the presence of evil in our lives. See this (referring to the slide picture) is an initiate inside what was known as the “Jed” or “Djed” pillars depending on how certain people want to pronounce it and these Djed pillars represented stability and enlightenment and they represent the two principles: the sacred feminine principle of non-aggression, and the sacred masculine principle of self defense. The initiate is the enlightened one, who is incorporated and bridged both pillars, and has come to the place of cosmic illumination which is represented by the winged disk of Maat in the Khemetian tradition, which is over the lintel of the two pillars. That winged disk of Maat; Maat was considered a great mother goddess in the Khemetian, the ancient Egyptian traditions. She was the force; she was a personified deity. The ancient khemetians didn’t actually worship a physical woman, it’s not what this was. It was the personification of truth and justice and order and Natural Law that was encapsulated as the sacred feminine essence. She was above all the other deities in the pantheon of egyptian deities, of Khemetian deities. Maat, there was no god or goddess higher. And how they looked at alignment with Maat is: if you wanted to have order and you wanted to avoid chaos, you learned the teachings of Maat because she was the goddess of justice and she was the goddess of righteousness. She was the goddess that brought order if you aligned yourself to her teachings, and her teachings were Natural Law.

so that’s what this is here, this is saying: we need to take away the word, it’s not saying remain silent and don’t use your voice, it’s not what it’s ever been saying. This is a symbolic allegory for the apology. You know what else the G in the middle of the compass and square is? Apollo-G: the sun, the light, the generative principle. We need to make the apollo-G. That’s what the G in the middle of the compass and square in allegory also represents because one of the big deities, the Greek deities that is often kind of exemplified in the Free Masonic tradition, is Apollo. He was a sun god, and he was a corollary to Horus in the Egyptian tradition, and Jesus in the Christian tradition, and mithras in the Persian tradition and many other sun gods that represented truth and light. so that’s the middle way, the middle pillar; that’s what the initiate represents. I started this presentation with a slide “before we begin,” now we have begun, and it’s up to you to take it further. What you’ll do with this knowledge is entirely up to you.
