title: Problem Solving
description: There are a few main steps to solving a problem, any problem at all. It doesn't matter what the nature of the problem is.

## Overcome Fear

Fear-based denial must first be dealt with and conquered; because denial will only make the problem grow bigger.

## Diagnose Accurately

Recognize that symptoms are merely effects of underlying causes. Instead of treating symptoms, you must make an accurate diagnosis of the cause(s) of the problem. (Diagnosis: from the Greek preposition 'Dia- (δια)' meaning 'Through / By way of,' and the Greek noun 'Gnosis (γνωσις)' which means 'Knowledge.' The term 'Diagnosis' etymologically means 'By way of knowledge') And in doing so, you will come to an understanding of what cause has put certain symptoms into effect.

## Act

Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required action(s) necessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem.

so, will people as a whole, as a society accept that master key? I can’t answer that question, all I can do is try to place it into their hands, after I have taken that key and unlocked my personal prison, my personal cages and freed my mind. All I can do is try to help people to see, here’s how this key works. Here it is, here’s the information that constitutes that key and here’s how you put it to work in your life. That’s all I can do. I can’t make anybody take it.

Let’s look at what problem solving entails because that’s really critical to understand if we’re going to get past this stage in where we’re at in our stifled evolutionary development as a species. There’s a few main steps to solving problems, any problem, doesn’t matter what the nature of the problem is. The first is you have to recognize that the problem exists, recognize that there is a problem to begin with, and I think by asking the question “is everybody content with the way things are” and nobody raised their hand. I think that’s great because it at least acknowledges to me that people here today recognize we have a problem, and that’s healthy, that’s good. Many people out there don’t believe we have a problem. They like this place, they like the world the way that it is, which is unfathomable to me because to me it’s a living hell, and that’s not because of how my own personal life is going. I’m very content with my own personal life; I have no self-inflicted suffering in my personal life. I don’t create problems for myself. My life goes on very well according to how I live it without hurting anybody else. The problem is other people, and that’s another thing the new agers won’t acknowledge and they’ll flip out if you say there’s a problem with someone else. There are problems with other people, okay. And people will say, “people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.” My glass house has been taken down long since, long time ago because I went through all that personal introspective work and I dug deep into my subconscious and faced those problems and confronted them head on and healed them and came out of the mind-set that I was once in.

People will say, “if there’s something you don’t like in other people, that’s something in yourself that you’re seeing in them.” This is new age mumbo jumbo nonsense, okay. If you’re not part of the problem, I’m not part of this problem; I can say that honestly, I’m not part of this problem. I can look every single person, anybody who’s watching this and say, “I’m not part of the problem that’s happening on the earth,” with all honesty and knowing that I’m telling the truth with that. But see, at one point, I was part of the problem, and a big part of the problem. What I had to do at some point is stop doing this
(pointing the finger at others) and pointing out and saying the problem lies elsewhere while I was still part of it. And then I had to do this and point squarely at myself and say what do I need to change here (mind), here (heart) and finally here in the guts, in the courage. People will say change happens in the mind, it happens in the heart, but lastly it happens in the guts. We need to generate what I call the heart-mind-guts. You got to care (pointing at the heart) enough to know (pointing at the mind) and then put it to action (pointing at the guts). The heart-mind-guts. Taking action is the most important step when it comes to creating change, and we’re gonna get to that in a moment.

but the whole point here is, I had to look at what I needed to change about myself in my thoughts, my emotions and my actions, and then change those things in myself. This is what most people want to run away from, they want to say “yea, I want those things that I say I want to be present in my life, but I don’t want to do those things that require self change in how I think and how I feel and in how I act. I want it magically to happen without changing those things in me.” So I can honestly look at the rest of the world and say, “the problem does not lie within me, I am not seeing a manifestation of myself in other people.” Other people have not done the same process that I have, the introspective work that I have, and gone through that painful, painstaking work that involves effort, hard effort. I’m not up here telling people “I’m offering you the tonic, you’re going to take a sip and magically you will be enlightened.” Knowing what’s going on in the world is hard work. It involves destruction; it’s a destructive process. It involves destruction of belief systems. It involves completely breaking down barriers that are in your head. Hardly anybody wants to do that work. People want to run a million miles an hour in the opposite direction from that work. “Anything but that, I’ll take the grave instead of that,” that’s where most people’s heads are at.

let’s get back to the steps here for problem solving. The first is, you got to recognize there’s a problem, if you’re in denial, good luck, let me know how that works out for you, because you’re not solving any problem in a state of denial, at all. Fear-based denial of the problem must first be dealt with and conquered and stamped out, and you have to acknowledge how bad it is. People feel symptoms coming on of a disease or something and they want to ignore it because they don’t want to believe “I’m sick, I don’t believe i’m sick, I don’t want to believe I have a problem.” Then you’re waiting waiting waiting, you don’t get it diagnosed and then it turns into a much bigger problem, which is where we’re at as a society for ignoring this information.

This is what denial looks like symbolically: a person with their head in the sand like an ostrich. And please take note ladies and gentlemen; when you’re in this position, when you’re in the position of denial with your head in the sand, you’re on your knees with your ass in the air. I almost say it’s amazingly synchronistic that the human body was designed like that. That in order to put your head in the sand, symbolically so- to-speak, you have to be on your knees. And that’s where most of our society is at, they’re on their knees and in that state of denial.

The second step to problem solving is to recognize that the symptoms that are being displayed, the symptoms you are seeing are merely effects of underlying causal factors. You can’t treat symptoms and solve a problem, it’s not possible. That’s not how problem solving works. You have to get to what caused the problem. Instead of simply treating symptoms, make an accurate diagnosis of the causes of the problem.

So what does the word diagnosis mean? Diagnosis comes from Greek. The preposition dia transliterated there in the parentheses you see it in Greek script. It means through or by way of, so, by a method, by a particular method. The second part of diagnosis is the Greek nous gnosis. Gnosis means knowledge in Greek, so what a diagnosis means is, through knowledge or by way of knowledge, you’re going to solve the problem by way of knowledge. There is knowledge that acts as the requirement to solving the problem and getting what you want. And here’s another thing I’m going to keep going back to this is, it’s going to be like an undercurrent in this because the new age community: I have been, but am going to become a more outspoken opponent of new age ideologies because they are lying to people whether it be through direct willful deception, or whether it be through useful dupes and useful idiots. They are telling people things that are completely inaccurate to how things really work because they want to keep people suppressed and non-active. They want people in acceptance-mode of everything. Accept accept accept- never rebel. Don’t take action, just observe, just watch; you’ll hear all these things in the new age movement. The reason I bring it up is
because when you even say the word knowledge to some new agers, they almost take offense because what the new age is becoming, is the new modern day variant, it’s a new form of what’s known as solipsism and we’re gonna get to what solipsism is in a little while.
essentially, people don’t want to hear that knowledge is what is required because the attainment of real knowledge, not pseudo-knowledge, real knowledge requires work. It requires effort, it requires reading, it requires listening, it requires watching, and you know what most of all it requires that people don’t want to give up? Who can tell me?
(Audience response) Time, thank you sir. It requires time. There’s one of the currencies people don’t spend on many things that they don’t feel they can get immediate gratification from, which is why immediate gratification is so stressed in our society by the control system because that’s what keeps people in their ignor-ance. So, a diagnosis means, if you’re going to get well, you got to have the knowledge of the underlying causal factors that led to the creation of the symptoms. You’re not going to treat the symptoms and get well. You got to have the knowledge to get to the causal factors to find out what cause put this into effect, and we’re going to talk a lot about cause and effect.

The third step to problem solving is: through the knowledge that you’ve acquired now, via making an accurate diagnosis of the problem of the causal factors, you’re going to then put that knowledge into action. Understanding what created the problem is step two, stop being in denial, understand what caused the problem, act on the knowledge you now have to solve the problem to make it right. So action is required. we make the diagnosis, then we have to take the required action necessary to rectify or to set right, which is what the word rectify means, the causal factors that led to the manifestation of the problem.
