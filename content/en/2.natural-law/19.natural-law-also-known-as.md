## Transcript

### Part 96
Natural Law has been called many different things in different traditions throughout the world at different times in history.

### Part 97
Let's look at what some people have called it: it's been called the Law of cause and Effect, or the Laws of Cause and Effect. And there's a scientific connotation to this concept of cause and effect too, even scientists will say: an effect invariably follows a cause. And they'll also say things like: for every action, there exists an equal and opposing reaction. So, there's a consequence when an action is taken.

in the more new age circles you've heard it referred to as the Law or Laws of Attraction. i call this presentation: The Real Law of Attraction. However, there are some good things that the new age community, and I won't tell you it's all bad, I don't make that blanket statement. It is a religion in many respects, but however, there are some truths embedded in it that can be taken on their own and value can be gleaned from. One of those sayings is: the energy we emit is the energy we attract. This is true. What we're putting out into the universe is what we're getting in return from the universe and what we're creating in our reality. “Energy flows where attention goes.” I just talked about this in the last section; what we put our attention on is what ultimately what gets manifested in the world. “As you think, feel and act, so shall you be.” Some of the teachers of the different variants of attraction teachings have only put the first part in that, “as you think so you will be.” No, as you think, feel, and act, so will you be, and most of all, so you act, so will you will be.

so, it's been called Karma. It's been called Moral Law as I talked about before. And this is captured beautifully by the phrase: “what we sow, we reap.” The seeds that you scatter, that's what's gonna grow, and that's the fruit that you're going to harvest. So, a very accurate way of looking at it. And again, it’s been called Consequentialism, that's another thing I could put into this chart, in other words, that there is free will, but there’s no free will without consequence. That's called Consequentialism. That would be another very accurate way of referring to Natural Law. And finally, the Golden Rule, it’s been called. And it's been stated in the affirmative as: “Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.” I find this much more powerfully stated in the negative, or what I call the “apophatic” variant. And we'll talk about what apophatic and apophasis means in a few moments. I think it would’ve been much less ambiguous, the golden rule, if it was said like this: “Do not do to others as you would prefer not to have done unto you.” Now the ambiguity goes away because people want to be treated slightly differently. Hey, a masochist might want to get beaten by a sadist. But that doesn't mean; do that to others because you like it. But people know what they don't want. They don't want their Rights taken; they don't want their property taken or damaged; they don't want to be harmed in their person. They don't want any of those things. They don't want to be lied to, they don't want to be deceived. So, don't do any of those things to other people.
