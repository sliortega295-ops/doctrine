description: Everyone has the exact same rights Nobody has any more or any less rights than anyone else.

## Not Granted or Gifted
Since rights are not created by humanity, and since they are the birth-right of humanity, gifted to us by the Creator of the universe. Not a single person or group of people is capable of "granting" or "gifting" rights to anyone else, nor is any person capable of revoking rights from anyone else. Including Governments.

<!-- > Government is nothing but men acting in concert. The morality and value of government, like any other association of men, will be no greater and no less than the morality and value of the men comprising it. Since government is nothing but men, its inherent authority to act is in no way greater or different than the authority to act of individuals in isolation. Government has no 'magic powers' or 'authority' not possessed by private individuals. Let he who asserts that government may do that which the individual may not assume the onus of proof and demonstrate his contention."  
> **Chris Lyspooner, Ludwig von Mises Institute -->

## What Government Really Is
The word **_Government_** is derived from the Latin verb **_Gubernare_** which means "to Control, to Rule, or to Direct". (just as was shown earlier with the etymological breakdown of the word "Sovereign", there is no "V sound" in classical Latin. This can be readily seen in the name of the ceremony for electing a governor; they are called **_Gubernatorial_** elections.) The second part of the word "Government" is derived from the Latin noun **_Mens_** which means **_Mind_**. Therefore, put together the word "Govern-ment" etymologically means "Mind Control".

::note
Government is Mind Control
::

The etymological origin of the English suffix **_-ment_** is often debated, yet it is quite clear that those who created the English language deliberately chose **_Mens_** the Latin word for **_Mind_**, to mean "the State of-" or "the Condition of-", in direct keeping with the first Hermetic principle, the principle of Mentalism. Which demonstrates that in order for any particular event, circumstance, state or condition to exist in our current manifested reality (the plane of effects), it must first have existed in the mind (the plane of causality).

## The Illusion of Authority
Government is based on the illusory concept called "Authority". People that believe certain other people are authorities, means they believe that those individuals have rights that other people do not. Mainly, the rights to command, compel, coerce and constrain.

Authority is based upon an equally illusory concept called "Jurisdiction". The word
**_Jurisdiction_** is derived from the Latin noun **_Jus_** or **_Juris_** which means "Right, or Law", and the Latin verb **_Dictere_** which means "to Speak, or to Say". Thus, the word "Jurisdiction" literally means "to Say what the law is". In other words, to "make up" or to "decide" what the law is.

"Authority" is an illusion of a diseased psyche, based entirely in violence and built upon the false belief that some people are "masters" who have the moral right to issue commands, and that other people have a moral obligation to obey those commands. Simply put, slavery.

::note
The belief in the legitimacy of "Authority" is the belief in the legitimacy of Slavery.

The concept of government and the concept of authority are forms of (false) religion, yet most people fail to see it that way. The word **_Religion_** is derived from the Latin verb **_Religare_** which means "to Tie back, to Hold back, to Thwart from forward progress, or to Bind.'

A false religion is a system of control based in unchallenged, dogmatic belief which holds back the progress of consciousness.

::tip
We should stop trying to make our religion truth, and start making truth our religion.

## The One True Divide
There is only one true divide that separates humanity into two distinct types of individuals. The criterion for this divide is whether or not a person believes in “authority,” and therefore believes that there is legitimacy to slavery. That is the only divide which truly separates us.

### Transcript

#### Slide 182
This is a system of slavery that is not needed. There is equality under natural Law, perfect equality. Everyone has the exact same Rights. No one has any more or less Rights than anyone else. Also, since Rights are not created by humanity and since they are the birthright of humanity, gifted to us by the creator of the universe, no human being or group of human beings is actually capable in reality of granting Rights to anyone else, nor is any human being capable of revoking Rights from anyone else. everybody has the same Rights. No one can make up a new Right. No one can grant a not a Right to somebody that is actually a Wrong. Does not exist, never has existed, never will exist. This is an illusory belief system. I'm not telling you people “don't believe that can be done.” I'm telling you in reality, in Truth, it can never be done.

#### Slide 183
Chris Lyspooner phrased it pretty well, he said, “government is nothing but men acting in concert. The morality and value of government, like any other association of men, will be no greater or no less than the morality and value of the men comprising it. since government is nothing but men, it's inherent ‘authority’ to act is in no way greater or different than the ‘authority’ to act of any individuals in isolation.” Like that example of two people on the planet. “Government has no ‘magic powers’ or ‘authority’ that is not possessed by private individuals. Let he who asserts that government may do that, which the individual may not do, assume the onus of proof.” That means the burden of proof. “And demonstrate his contention.” And you know what? There's nobody on this planet that can do that. Cause when it comes down to it, if you're telling somebody else, they may either commit a Wrong against somebody else or prevent someone else from exercising a Right, that's a lie. And that does not exist. Not in reality. It exists in a diseased mind is where it exists. Only in a sick mind is where that belief exists. You have to be imbalanced in the mind, in the psyche, to believe that that's true. It's a mental illness. I mean that's what it really is.

#### Slide 184
The word government, you break it down. People say this word every day almost, and yet they've never looked at the etymological roots of the word. It comes from the Latin verb gubernare. Once again, no V in classical Latin, no V. okay, so again, these were rendered as either B’s or P’s in classical Latin language. You could write this in what would be more modern Latin as guvernare with a V, but in classical latin or ancient Latin, there is no V, so it would have been rendered with a B: gubernare. now, what's the election of a governor called? It's called a gubernatorial election. gubernatorial: Gubernare is in there. Okay. Gubernare means to control. The verb gubernare in Latin means to control. The Latin noun mens , which is where the part, the second part of the word ment , is derived from, means mind.

#### Slide 185
So, you put these together and the word government actually literally from its etymological roots means: to control the mind, or in other words ‘mind control.’ Now i'm going to put something else up here for a moment.

#### Slide 186
The etymological origin of the English suffix - ment, M-E-N-T is often debated in this etymological breakdown. Alright? And I've gotten stuff about this
constantly, and I've told people I'm not interested in hearing about it anymore. I know where this comes from. I know why the creators of the English language made it so, made it like this. It is overwhelmingly clear by people who have studied linguistics and the origins of words, okay. In English, from ancient languages that the creators of the english language deliberately chose the Latin noun mens, meaning mind, to represent or mean in English; the state of or the condition of. And this was done in direct keeping with the first Principle of Natural Law: as we've already discussed, The Principle of mentalism, which demonstrates that in order for any particular thing, event, or circumstance, any state or condition to exist in manifested reality, as it currently does, which is known as the plane of effects, it must have first existed in the plane of causality or the mental realm, the mind. We've already looked at that Principle of Natural Law, so anything that ends in ment ; the original etymological derivation means that it was made that way first by a state of mind, which led to its creation in physical reality. any word you can think of that ends in M-E-N-T, meaning the state or the condition of, means: it happened in mind first, and therefore it led to the state of or the condition of in physical reality.


#### Slide 185)
So, when I say that government means mind control, it literally does and that is an accurate etymological breakdown. The word mens was deliberately chosen for specific reasons, and I just explained the reason of that meaning: the state of or the condition of, and many people want to hotly contest that, I'm telling you outright they're wrong. They don't understand why that was chosen. Mens , meaning mind, was chosen deliberately to mean the state of where the condition of.


#### Slide 187)
Government is based on this illusory and false concept called authority. people think certain people are authorities: that they actually have Rights that other people don't have. The Right to command, compel, coerce, and tell people, “this is Right, this is what you're going to do, and if you disagree, I have the power to actually compel, coerce or constrain you against your will, if you're not harming anybody even, in the taking of that action.” Authority is based upon an equal illusion that is called jurisdiction. Now we break down this word. It comes from the Latin noun: Jurisdiction comes from Latin: jus , juris. Jus , juris in Latin means law. Juris is the possessive case. and the Latin verb dictere. So, jus-dictere , juris-dictere = jurisdiction. Okay. Dictere means: to say or to speak. Thus jurisdiction literally means to say what the law is, or in other words, “we get to make up what the Law is. The law is not something that exists in nature and is based upon Right and Wrong and Truth and Morality. No, we get to make it up. We're God. We get to say what's Right and what's Wrong and therefore, since we make the law, we're the owners of these people. They're in our jurisdiction: you know, we own them, and we get to make up what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.”


#### Slide 188)
Authority ultimately is an illusion again, of a diseased mind, diseased psyche; based entirely in violence and built upon the erroneous and dogmatic belief that some people are masters who have the moral right to issue commands and others are slaves who have a moral obligation to obey the commands of the masters.


#### Slide 189)
I don't care what you want to call it; you can euphemize it any way you want. I call it what it really is: slavery. That's what it really is. It doesn't come down to anything else. You can call it whatever you want: euphemize it, try to make it sound as nice or as pleasant as possible. It's all one thing; it's called slavery. It's always immoral, and it needs to be ended. That's it. And we have to develop the knowledge and the courage to end it- the knowledge, the care, and the courage to end it.


#### Slide 190)
The belief in the legitimacy of “authority,” this illusory nonsense notion, is the belief in the legitimacy of slavery. Anybody who believes in that authority is legitimate, and government is legitimate, whether they want to admit it or not, or know it or not or understand it or not, I don't care what they believe; they are advocating the legitimacy of slavery.

that's not my belief. I don't care who calls that my belief. I'm just looking right into the camera and saying this because I know the people in this room know that that's not my belief. I'm telling anybody who's listening to this. That's not my belief, that's eternal truth. Eternal truth. (If) you believe in these concepts, you are a supporter of slavery, the end. That's how it really is, not because I said so, because that's how it really is. And that's called mind control. For somebody to believe that slavery is legitimate, you've gotta be under deep mind control. You gotta be either that or a sick psychopathic, absolute piece of garbage, okay? One of those things or another is true if you believe in those concepts. Again, I'm not afraid to tell it to somebody right to their face like that. I don't care. I'm not here to serve truth, make friends or be liked, I'm here to tell people what the truth is. I'm sorry, I'm not here to serve human beings, make friends or be liked. i am here to serve the Truth. Whether it will be accepted is not up to me. I'm doing what i'm charged to do by creation. Whether it's accepted is somebody else's karma, not mine.


#### Slide 191)
Ultimately, authority is the idea that man can become God and through “jurisdiction,” dictate the law. What the dark occultists of this world who are behind ostensible governments in the world. You know, they set up all of these institutions as temples, right? What this sick psychopathic priest class ultimately believes is they're going to become God. We're going to turn Natural Law on top of its head, and we're going to rule in hell. That's it. We're going to rule in hell.


#### Slide 192)
It's a religion. This is a religion. Hey, governments is a religion, the concept of authority is a religion. Most people don't see it that way. And I mean religion in the term of false religion. It comes from the Latin religare. I laugh when I hear people say it comes from relegare or re-le-gare : R-E-L-E-G-A-R-E, Okay, which means to read over again; to go back over something that you've already read and read it again. it's the most ridiculous, nonsensical derivation I've ever heard for the word religion; to reread. I mean, please, let's put this to bed folks. Religion does not mean to reread. It doesn't come from relegare or re-le-gare , I can't remember which infinitive is used for that verb off hand. But, it comes from re-li-gare , hence: re-li-gion: R-E-L-I-G-A-R-E, all right? Religare means to tie back, to hold back or to thwart from forward progress by tying or binding, tying up so that you can't move forward. That's what religare is and that is the etymological root of religion, because a false religion is a system of control that is based in unchallenged dogmatic belief, which keeps the mind in a prison in order to hold back the progress of consciousness. And that's where the bulk of humanity is at, in a brain cage. They're in the mind cage, okay? There is a positive connotation of religion. It also means to reunite with. And what we need to reunite ourselves with is the truth and common sense and Natural Law and knowledge that there is no such thing as legitimacy to slavery. That's what we need to reunite with, and then we’d be living with true religion. We'd be practicing true religion instead of fake religion.

we've got to stop trying to make our religion truth, and we've got to start making Truth our religion. That's what needs to be done.
