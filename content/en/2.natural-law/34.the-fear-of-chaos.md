title: The Fear of Chaos
description: Chaos shouldn't be viewed as something to be feared, it should rather be viewed as a teacher. Definitely a harsh teacher, but a teacher nonetheless. It teaches us through the apophatic process, what not to do.

## Do Not Burn Yourself

What you see pictured above is obviously a bad idea and you probably shouldn't do that; if your desire is not to burn your hand up to the point of blistering and your skin coming off. But if you don't care about that happening, then by all means, keep your hand right on that burner. However, if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining that condition. That means you can't keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or Natural Law will take over and burn your hand.

In our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be burned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is switched on, and NOT be burned!” But obviously, it doesn't work that way.

If you don't want to be burned, your hand can't be kept there while the stove is on; if you don't want self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you've got to align your behavior to Natural Law. Which means you've got to know the objective difference between right and wrong behavior, and through free will choice deliberately choose right action over wrong action. And only then, will you not get burnt.

True freedom includes infinite possibility, which, by definition, includes the possibility of chaos. This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free.

## The Fear of True Freedom

For real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there could be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpected happening, something going wrong, or someone getting hurt; but if you are living in that state of fear, you are living in a very low state of consciousness.

Fear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because it is based in fear (see 'Natural Law expressions' chart). The fear of the possibility of chaos is the fear of true freedom. This can also symbolically be seen as the “death” of the imagination.

## Imagination
Imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. This is because, according to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world (plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of causality).

::caution
If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible.
::

Through their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), most people advocate the
legitimacy and continuance of “authority” and government, and are therefore actually
advocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery.

Those who believe that “authority” is necessary and that it must continue, have been duped into believing that human slavery is necessary and must continue in order to prevent chaos.

::tip
Violence and slavery cannot prevent chaos. Violence and slavery are chaos.

## Transcript

### Part 201
The fear of chaos: this is what keeps this system going.

### Part 202
Chaos can't be viewed as something to fear. It's gotta be viewed as a teacher, a harsh teacher, but a teacher nonetheless. See, chaos teaches us through the apophatic process what not to do. Okay, that's a bad idea. You probably shouldn't do that if your desire is not to burn your hand to the point where it's blistering, and flesh is starting to peel off of it. If you don't care about whether that happens, by all means, keep it right on that stove, right on that electric stove. (Referring to the slide) but see, if you say “I don't want to be burned,” there are requirements for obtaining that condition. It means you can't keep your hand on something that is extraordinarily hot, or Natural Law will take over and burn your flesh- doesn't require your belief. That's how it works. well, this is humanity. Humanity is the little child that is a little slow, and they want not to be burned, yet simultaneously they insist, “no, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is on and not be burned simultaneously.” Well, good luck with that, folks, because it doesn't work that way. You don't want to be burned? The hand can't be kept there while the stove is on. The end. You don't want negative self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life? You got to align your behavior to Natural Law. Which means you've got to know the difference objectively between Right and Wrong, and willfully through your free will choose, deliberately choose the Right action over the wrong action. Then you won't be burned. But as long as you have your hand on that stove, which means you're in opposition to Natural Law, enjoy the burn, enjoy it. Get used to it, till the flesh melts off the bone, and then the bones turn into dust, because that's what you're going to get. That's how it works. And again, nobody wants to hear that. they don't want to hear that the Natural Laws don't care about you. They work flawlessly all the time and bring you the result that you're creating.

### Part 203
The control and slavery system is actually about the limitation of free will through the destruction of possibility. See, all they've done; The old-world order used to be religion and priest kings, right? “We're in between you and God. We're the intercessors, the intermediaries. We make the law. You're our subjects, you are our slaves, you obey or it's our wrath.” All they've done is take the concept of a singular ruler, which was the old world order, and they've converted it into the concept of now there's a ruling class called Government that gets to make up what we tell you what you may or may not do. And they're up here at the top of the pyramid now, that's all. They turned it from a monarchy to somewhat of an oligarchy, but it's the same concept. “We're the moral masters that you have a moral obligation to obey, and you're the slave class that has an obligation to obey our commands.” That's it. Nothing changed. All they did is say, “well, people no longer believe in the priest king, so we need to create an institution where this “authority” is seemingly diffused through many people. It's always been nonsense. It's always been mind control. It's not going to be anything else other than that until it goes away.

### Part 204
True freedom includes infinite possibility because infinite possibility by definition includes the possibility for chaos. For real freedom to exist, we have to accept “hey, things might not go right all the time. We live in a physical domain, a physical world, there could be dangers.” Nothing could ever be sanitized or made completely safe as far as physical world activities are concerned. There's always going to be the possibility something could happen, go wrong, somebody could get hurt, chaos could happen. If you live in that state of fear that that's going to happen, what is that? Is that high consciousness or low consciousness? It’s low consciousness. Low consciousness can only create what? Chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos because it's based in fear. As we just keep referring to that expression chart, you know. go online (www.whatonearthishappening.com) I have slides of it online; it's in videos i've done. Print it, read it, look at it, print it and stick it up in your home. Understand how that chart works. You know those expressions that I went over, those 10 expressions. The possibility of chaos from manifesting, the possibility that it may manifest has to be embraced without fear. If we're going to be truly free it must be embraced, you have to say, “I am going to allow for the possibility that chaos may occur” because that's getting out of the consciousness of fear.

### Part 205
Which, that's what will lead to freedom, removing that fear. The fear of the possibility of chaos is actually equated to the fear of true freedom. When somebody says,
“I can't ever believe that a system with no masters could work out, I can't even envision how it could work out.” What's that called? What's been deadened in that person, what have they lost?

### Part 206
Imagination. There it is. That is actually the equivalent of the death of the imagination. Now, what is the imagination?

### Part 207
The imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one which is already manifested in the present. So, imagination must first be present in the mind in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. And this is because, according to the principle of Mentalism, for any different state to manifest in the physical world, the plane of effects, it must first exist within the mind or the plane of causality. If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, and the destruction of the imagination is what I refer to as total mind control, you can't go into any more total mind-controlled state as the imagination being dead. All right? If that happens, any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible. And this is where many people are already at. The fear of the possibility of chaos is more than even the fear of true freedom. It is the death of the imagination. It is putting the mind permanently in the cage. So, you can't let that force within us called the imagination die because that's the only way to envision a way out of the prison. You have to envision it first, then you have to put those thoughts and emotions that you used for that envisioning process into actual action so that it becomes manifested in the physical world


### Part 208
Through their fear of the possibility of chaos, which is actually the fear of true freedom, most people advocate the legitimacy and continuance of authority and
government, and are therefore actually advocating the legitimacy and continuance of
violence and slavery.


### Part 209
Those who believe that authority is necessary and that it must continue because of this fear of chaos have actually been duped into believing that human slavery is necessary, and get this folks: human slavery must therefore, continue in order to
“prevent chaos.” Now imagine that. Imagine that.
that's what statism is though. That's what the religion called the belief in government or statism is. It is the belief that human slavery is necessary and must continue indefinitely in order to prevent chaos from manifesting. Now, tell me how that could possibly work?


### Part 210
Can violence and slavery, which is actually what government is a euphemism for: statism and government are just euphemisms for violence and slavery. can violence and slavery ever possibly prevent chaos? Why? (Audience response) what? Why can't it? Because they are chaos.

Violence and slavery are chaos. We are already in the state of chaos. being held under the threat of violence and duress, which is slavery is the state of chaos. so, forget about fearing chaos coming on. You're in it now. Surprise, surprise. Hate to break the news to you all. We're already in the state of chaos. We need to create real order by getting rid of violence and slavery.
