title: Taxation, Prohibition, Licenses & Permits
description: Let's examine Taxation for what it really is, without euphemizing.
---

## What Taxation Really Is
Taxation is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given or delegated the "right" to (forcibly) confiscate an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual's labour (a form of property), whether or not that person agrees to share that product voluntarily (coercion is involved).

## Enforced by Threats
Taxation is enforced by the following threats:

1. **Theft** -  Seizing property that is rightfully a person's possession.
2. **Imprisonment** - Taking away the physical freedom of movement.
3. **Violence** - Behavior resulting in bodily harm, if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist the confiscation.

::note
These practices is always "justified" by those who claim that such practices are necessary and required to uphold the common good.
::

## Justification

The word "Justified" etymologically derives from the Latin noun **_Jus_** or **_Juris_** which mean "Right, Law", and the Latin verb **_Facere_** which means "to Create, or to Make". Therefore, "to Justify" etymologically means "to Create right, to Create law."

## Involuntary Confiscation
If we define the concept of slavery as: the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of labour of another person, we can clearly see that there is no percentage to which we could lower this number (other than 0%) that would no longer constitute slavery. Many people try to justify this by saying this money is used for different services. However, we aren't able to refuse most of these "services".

Imagine, you have a computer at home; one day a computer technician knocks on your door and tells you: "I am now your computer technician, and you are not allowed to refuse my services." Immediately the right to choose (free will) has been taken away from you. Then he tells you "Whether you want or don't want my technician services, I'm going to need $300, every year, and I'll come over every two months to collect my money. I do not care if you are happy with my service or not, and if you refuse to pay me, I will take your computer."

## Duress

Does it seem like the computer is truly yours, if you are living under that kind of coercion? Or does it seem more like a violent criminal telling you: "I am going to steal your possessions if you don't give me what I tell you to." That sounds more like a form of extortion or duress, and that is what all forms of taxation fall under.

## Taxation Is Slavery
If we are being completely honest with ourselves, taxation is merely a euphemism for theft, violence, and slavery; these are the three practices on which it is actually truly based. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim ownership of the product of another person's labour, such behavior can never be delegated to a group of people, and called a "right." Therefore:

All forms of taxation are always wrong according to Natural Law.

## Prohibition
Another important example of something to examine for what it actually truly is, is Prohibition. Whether regarding drugs or junk-food, ingesting anything harmful into the body is strongly opposed, hopefully for obvious reasons; purification of the body is an important part of purification of the mind.

description: It is crucial to recognize that anyone should be allowed to put anything inside their body, because they own their body.</span>

If an individual, for whatever reason, wants to ingest any given substance they always have the right to do so; because their body is their property. People easily tend to overthink the concept when confronted with the question whether their body is theirs or not. They often pause and ask themselves questions like: "Am I going to own my body forever? I'm going to die someday, does that mean I don't own it now?" This is a complete over-mystification of the concept.

All sensible people recognize that they will die someday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies. Does that mean they don't own their body right now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives, exists inside) your body, which is one of the specific reasons you own your body, the other is that you are using your body right now. Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using it as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness. Your body is yours.

Continuing on the topic of Prohibition, it is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent others from putting any given substance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they will be fined or imprisoned. It should be self-evident that since an individual's body is their own property, that individual always maintains the natural right to decide what will or will not be put into their own property. In this instance, their own body.

Imagine another person telling you that you aren't allowed to put your jacket into your car, or that you can't put a certain piece of furniture inside your home. Why is it that most people would not accept that, but do accept this concept regarding their own body? - Because people can't seem to separate the act of imbibing the substance, and the action that someone may subsequently take, which are two different things.

A person may have some drinks, and get drunk if they wish to; but if that person goes out on the street afterwards and starts beating somebody up for no reason, they obviously have no right to do that. However, an individual
maintains the right to go drinking, or use cocaine, or even inject heroine into their arm. They obviously aren't good ideas, but every individual has the right to do so if they please; as long as their subsequent behavior isn't immoral and wrong. And if it is, they are still fully accountable for the actions they took, that's what personal responsibility is.

The two separate acts of a person having the right to put whatever they want into their own body, and still being personally responsible for whatever he or she may do with their body afterwards, need to be clearly delineated, and separated from one another.

description: Understanding this, we can easily see that the claim of "right" to dictate what will or will not be put into the body of another person amounts to a claim of ownership upon the other person's body.</span>

Imagine somebody telling you that you aren't allowed to eat carrots or drink orange juice for example. The claim of ownership upon another person's body is slavery. Therefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery, backed by violence, regardless of the justifications made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's body, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

::tip
All forms of prohibition are always wrong according to Natural Law.
::


## Licenses & Permits
Lastly, we will examine Licenses and Permits, keep in mind to also visualize the same scenario with only two people as was mentioned before. In that sense, most people can readily see that no single person, or group of people is able to legitimately make these claims towards another person; regarding taxation, prohibition, licenses and permits.

We have gotten to the point where most people actually believe that certain groups of people have created rights for themselves that other people don't have. Licenses and permits are claims that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent other people from exercising specific behaviors, even if such behaviors cause no harm to others, or their property.

Unless those people [petition](/en/reference/glossary#petition), or pay the government for permission (where the word "permit" is derived from) to be allowed to exercise those behaviors. This amounts to the claim that rights are merely privileges that may be granted or taken away by government at any time, based upon the people in government's preference or discretion.

Remembering that the definition of a [right](/en/reference/glossary#right) is: "any action which does not cause harm to another sentient being or their property". It can be readily seen that there is no such thing as the "right" to stop someone from exercising a right, since rights cause no harm.

The claim over the rights of another person is called slavery, regardless of the justification made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's rights, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

All forms of licensing and permits are always wrong according to Natural Law

## Transcript

### Part 151
let's look at this scenario: so, there's our world, and there's two people, two well- groomed businessmen, and we're going to look at an instance. Let's look at taxation, the concept of taxation. Is taxation of any kind a Right or a Wrong? Is it morally acceptable and justifiable, or is it something that is actually a Wrong? Well let’s look at what taxation really is, and again we're not going to euphemize, we're going to talk about it straight on.

### Part 152
So, here's what taxation is; it's not what I believe it is, I'm getting down to the heart of the matter and describing what it actually is. Taxation is the claim that a specific group of people who call themselves government have been given a “Right,” they've been delegated a Right, we've written down a law, and we say these people calling themselves government and the IRS have a Right to do this particular action, this activity, this behavior. They've been given a Right to confiscate, unwillingly, I might add, an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual's labor.
now let me just start with this alright, you ask anybody, “how many of you are
voluntarily gonna pay more taxes?” Nobody'll raise their hand. And you say, “why
not?” “Well, because I can barely afford to pay the ones I'm paying right now, and I don't want to volunteer any more money toward that endeavor. Quite frankly I want my resources for myself to use as I see fit voluntarily.” But if the government then said well your taxes are going up by 5%, how many people would pay them? Most people would because subconsciously, or consciously, they recognize they’re under coercion. They're actually under duress. They're being told that if they don't give this at the command of the people who are confiscating it, that some form of violence will be conducted upon them: whether through the form of fining them and saying “we're gonna take more of your resources,” whether by saying “we're going to put you in a cage and make you stay there as long as we say you need to stay there,” or by actually conducting actually physical harm upon you.
again, we're saying that this “Right” is given to individuals who call themselves government. And then they have the Right to confiscate this arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual’s labor. Because that's what money is, or that's what whatever we make through what we work, that's the product of our labor; we work, and then we get compensated for it. So, that's an exchange for labor that we have done, that's our property because we gave labor in return for that. This is done whether or not the other agrees to share that product voluntarily, it's not a voluntary process, coercion is involved. Taxation is enforced by the threat of violence, which is behavior that will result in bodily harm, or imprisonment, which is the taking away of the physical freedom of movement if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist this confiscation.
this practice is always “justified,” and the word justify actually breaks down etymologically, the word justify means “to create a Right,” that's what justify actually means. Jus in Latin means Right, or Law, and then facao/facere means to create or to make. So, to justify means to create Right, to make a Right up and conjure it into existence. So, it's always justified or made into a “Right” by those who claim that such a practice is necessary and required to “uphold the common good.” This is the justification offered for the seizure of the product of peoples labor involuntarily.
now, if we are honest with ourselves, if we define the concept of slavery, and I think this is a good definition for slavery: would it be fair to say slavery is the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of the labor of another human being? Would that be a fair definition? You're saying you’re working; “I'm going to take whatever you generate as a result of that work that you're doing, it doesn’t belong to you, the product of your labor doesn't belong to you, all of it belongs to me. So, you work for me, I take everything that you have been able to amass or create through the labor that you have done.” I think everybody here would agree that's slavery, that's as good a definition of slavery as you're probably going to get. I mean we can come up with some other definitions that involve coercion and physically shackling and keeping people, but if we really are honest with ourselves, what is the purpose of slavery to begin with, is to make others work for free and then take all the product of the labor. That's what slavery was conducted for.
if we're defining slavery as the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of the labor of another human being, we should be able to clearly see that there is no magical percentage to which we could lower this number that would no longer make it slavery. so, I ask people if the person who's saying “I want to confiscate 100% of labor and keep it for myself “ would say “well I'm going to take 75%, I'll take ¾ you can keep ¼ of what you've created” would that no longer constitute slavery? And I don't care what you say i'm gonna use that 75% for. If you're telling somebody “you have no choice, 75% of your labor belongs to me” would that no longer be slavery just because they allow them to keep 25%? Okay, let's lower it to 50%, is it still slavery? What percentage could it possibly be lowered to for it not to be slavery anymore? Only 0%. There is no percentage that it could be lowered to for it not to constitute slavery. And again, if we're being honest with ourselves, many people want to justify this in many ways by saying,
“oh, it's used for services,” services which someone doesn't have a Right to refuse. I tell people, “Hey, if I said to you, I'm a computer technician; you own a computer? Okay. i'm now your computer technician, you're not allowed to refuse my services.” Just think about that for a moment. You may not refuse that I am now providing the service for your computer to keep it in good shape.
first of all, what have I just taken from that gentleman? Right to choose, free will. Right there, that's slavery. I don't even have to keep going and say, “Hey! If you refuse, whether you want or don't want my computer services, I'm now your technician and I need $200 every year, I'll come over a couple of times, I don't care whether you're happy with my service or not, and if you don't pay me, I'm coming and taking the computer.” now is that really your property if you're living under that kind of duress or am I just a
violent criminal whose saying that I'm gonna steal your stuff if you don't give me what I say? I'm holding you under extortion. That's duress, that's called duress. It means I am threatening violence unto the person unless they conform to my will, and that's what we're all held under, we're held under duress. All forms of taxation are duress. It is a master class telling people “you have no Right to refuse the arbitrarily set confiscation of your labor that I deem is going to be necessary for what I say it's necessary for.”
so, how could you possibly claim that your home belongs to you if you're paying something called a property tax? That somebody is saying “for the services we provide in this community, you must pay us this percentage, and if you don't pay it your house is going to be turned over to the government, you know what that's called? There's a term for that when a society doesn't actually have true private property ownership Rights, and a higher class of masters actually owns the land and owns the property, and only allows the peasant class to live upon the property for as long as they pay tribute to the master class. Who can tell me what system of government that is? That's called feudalism, and that's the United States government and just about every government on the earth. You live in feudalism. There's no such thing as democracy, there's certainly not a constitutional republic that's for sure. The de facto state of government, which means in- deed/in-action is feudalism, and feudalism is just another euphemism, it’s a euphemism for slavery because slaves aren't allowed to own property. Slaves aren't allowed to keep the product of their labor. That's all it really is, if we're being honest with ourselves.
once again, there's my catchphrase for this section: if we want to euphemize it, justify it, call it something else, alright, I said it to that new-age woman at the UFO conference, and she said, again; “I prefer not to see it that way,” well you're not being honest with yourself, you're lying; it's called lying to yourself. That's what cognitive dissonance is, it's called lying to yourself. So, if we're being honest with our self, taxation is merely a euphemism for theft, violence and slavery: the practices upon which it is actually based, and since no individual anywhere on earth has the Right to claim ownership of the product of another's labor, such behavior can never be “delegated” to a group of people and called a “Right.” Therefore, it follows logically that all forms of taxation- I don't care what they are: excise tax, property tax, gift tax, inheritance tax, income tax, I don't care what form it is, taxes on corporations even. All forms of taxation are always Wrong according to Natural Law because they are all based in the destruction of free will, they are based on coercion, and they are ultimately based upon violence, all of which are wrongdoings. All of which are forms of theft and all of which, not one individual has the Right to perform upon another. And this is what people want to justify and believe can be magically turned into a Right, just because they want to euphemize it and call it taxation.

### Part 153
Let's look at another example: Prohibition. It's one of my pet peeves. I'm big into health, into eating right, I'm huge into juicing, it's one of my favorite things to do. purification of the body is part of the purification of the mind. But I'm going to tell you, i'm 100% for anybody being allowed to put anything into their body, because they own their body. If I want to break up this remote control into little pieces and eat it with a sprinkling of pepper, then that's my Right to do so regardless of what the chips may do to my intestinal tract. There is a reason I have the Right to eat this remote if I want to, you wanna know why? My body is my property; it belongs to me.
now we did this in the Natural Law seminar, we asked people: do you own your own body? Almost every single student in the seminar, of course, they immediately answered
“yes, I own my own body.” The students grasped this. The people they were asking the questions to, because the students were doing the tabulation of accumulating the answers from people that they asked the questions to, and one of the questions I asked them to ask people was “do you own your own body?” Almost every student in my first Natural Law seminar, when they asked people if they own their own body, they came back to the next class and almost every student said almost everybody they asked that question to paused for a long time and thought about it. Had to sit and think about this question. Could not immediately spit out “absolutely my body is my property,” because I think people want to overthink things and say “well, am I gonna own my body forever? I'm going to die one day, does that mean I own it now?” What's the over intellectualization and mystification of this concept? I tell people, “I recognize fully I’m going to die one day, this flesh is gonna crumble and pass into the earth.” Does that mean I don't own my own body right now? I'm using my body right now, that's why I own it, specifically. specifically because my consciousness inhabits this body and I'm using it as the vehicle for the expression of my consciousness, is the very reason I own my own body. And people can't spit that out; it's like unfathomable to me. The ridiculousness of some of this that the human mind could be worked into the situation that it has been, is almost
incomprehensible.
so, let's go forward with prohibition; it's the claim that a group of people who call themselves government have been given the Right to prevent others from putting any given substance into their own bodies. And if others refuse to comply with those terms that they will be fined or imprisoned. And it should be self-evident that if an individual's body is actually their own property, and it is, then that individual always maintains the natural Right to decide what will or will not be put into their property, which is their body. Why can you put what you want into your car or your home? Because you own it, it's your property. Okay. Technically it should be. I mean, you know, technically it isn't really, but my whole point is no other individual can tell you what you can and can't put into your home.

could I tell you “Hey, I don't want you putting that jacket in your car, you're not allowed to put it in there.” Well, who am I to tell you you're not allowed to put that in there? It's your property, so why would we not accept that, but we would accept, “I can't put something in my own body that I deemed that I want in it?” Okay. Because people can't separate the act of imbibing the substance or putting the substance into the body, from the action that people may subsequently take. And they're two different things. So, somebody might go out and want to get smashed tonight and do a bunch of drinking, but if you then go out on the street and start clubbing somebody with the nearest available blunt object, you don't have a Right to do that. You had a Right to go drinking, just as you would have a Right to go snort some cocaine or bang some heroin into your arm. I don't think those two things are particularly good ideas, but I support your Right to do it. but hey, if after you do those things, you go and hurt somebody else, you gotta be held accountable for the actions you just took. That's what personal responsibility is all about. and these two things need to be delineated from each other. We have to clearly be able to separate the act of the Right to put something into my body and me still being personally responsible for what I do with my body.

so, understanding that this is a claim made to tell people that “I'm going to make the decision about what you put into your body.” We can easily see this claim of this Right to command what will or will not be put into the body of another person, what it actually amounts to, is a claim of ownership upon the body of another person. If I'm telling you “you can't drink orange juice,” I'm making a claim; “your body belongs to me because i'm going to decide what goes into it or what does not go into it.” So, if I say carrots are off-limits for your consumption sir, and they may not be ingested, I've just made a claim that I own your body. Well, what's the claim on the ownership of another person's body called? Slavery, if we're not euphemizing it and if we're being honest with ourselves.
prohibition is merely the claim of ownership upon another person's body is called slavery. Therefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery that is backed by violence regardless of the justifications made by those who claim such practices are “necessary” for the common good; that's always the justification. Since no individual anywhere on earth has the Right to claim the ownership of another person's body, such behavior can never be delegated to a group and magically termed a Right. Therefore, all forms of prohibition are always Wrong according to Natural Law. It doesn't matter what the substance is. It doesn't matter what it is, how destructive it may be to the body or brain. Look, if I want to go under my sink, take some cleaning supplies and make a nice cocktail with some lye and some roach poison and some rat poison; stir it up in a water solution and go “glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.” That's my Right. Want to know why? because I own my body. I own my consciousness in my body- period the end. So, if I want to do that, that's my Right to do so. Okay? Nobody has a Right to tell me what I can and cannot put into my body. Yet we accept this because of these justifications they say, “it's for the common good. Forget what Rights are, it's for the common good. We need to accept slavery for the common good.” Yeah. Yeah it works out like that.

### Part 154
So, how about licenses and permits? These are claims that a group of people who call themselves government, and again we’re going back and visualizing, imagine one person trying to make this claim to another person; nobody would find it legitimate. nobody would find that one person may make that claim to another person. Yet we think these other people called government have Rights that individuals don't have. That's what we think, that's called mind control. Mind control is getting people to accept “some people have Rights that other people don't have.” That's what it is, you know? So, go back to that visualization exercise. Can one person make that claim over another and have it be legitimate? Of course not. So, if nobody has that Right, how could that Right be delegated to somebody else? It can’t. Licenses and permits: they’re claims that a group of people who call themselves government have been given the “Right” to prevent others from exercising specific behaviors, even if such behaviors cause no harm to others or their property. Unless those others petition, meaning beg or pay the government for “permission.” That's what a permit is, it means permission to be allowed to exercise those behaviors. This amounts to the claim that Rights are actually merely privileges that may be granted or revoked by government at any time. Based upon the people in governments’ preference, their discretion.
remembering that the definition of a Right is any action which does not cause harm to another living being or their property, there is no such thing as the “Right” to stop another person from exercising a Right. If something is a Right, meaning it doesn't cause harm, there is no such thing as someone's Right to stop you from performing that action. that would be called coercion, which is a Wrong. So, the actual ingestion of, let's say marijuana for example, harms no one else. You can put that into your body, sit there perfectly peacefully and not cause harm to another living being. That's called a Right for the very specific definition that it caused no harm. I would not have the Right to tell another individual “you may not do that action.” That would be a Wrongdoing. Well, it's the same thing for something when it comes to licenses and permits. You're telling people “Hey, if you pay me $50, I'll let you smoke that marijuana without doing violence to you, unless I changed my mind and then I won't give you a permit. I'll just say, hey, you're not allowed to do that.” Even something that is a Right like assembling and speaking, like what was done in the state of Pennsylvania a few years ago when the G20 visited in the city of Pittsburgh. The city telling people “we have revoked the Right to assemble and speak and petition for grievances. You don't have the Right to come and speak. No protests will be tolerated, or we'll hit you with sound in water cannons.” You know, and people just lay down and accepted it. The whole city of Pittsburgh, because
“Oh, we're going to go and ask them for a permit” and they just said no. Nope. “You don't have that Right anymore. We find you on the street; you're getting blasted with a sound cannon and deaf them.” Some people went permanently deaf. Permanently deaf. lost their hearing from what happened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

you see the stuff that was happening in, it wasn't Egypt, where they were hitting people with water cannons recently and killing some of them. It was in the Middle East somewhere. (Audience responds) Turkey, correct. Hitting people, some people died getting hit in the eye. With such pressure, it hits the brain. People dead from water cannons; they call these nonlethal weapons. They're telling you “you may not speak. you may not assemble. We're going to revoke that Right.” Really? See, there is no right to stop someone from exercising a preexisting Right. That's you making the claim “I own your Rights.” That's what that's really doing. That's saying, “I'm God, I get to grant what a Right is or revoke what a Right is at any given time.” That's basically what it is. It amounts to someone claiming to be God.

the claim over the Rights of another person is called slavery. Even more so, it is the claim to be God, the claim that the Rights of another flow from you. Therefore, licensing and permits are merely other euphemisms for slavery regardless of the justifications made by those who claim such practices are “necessary for the common good.” Since no individual anywhere on earth; no single individual has the Right to claim the ownership of another person's Rights, such behavior can never be delegated to a group and magically called a Right. Therefore, all forms of licensing and permits, according to natural Law, are always Wrongdoings because they are always based in coercion and the theft of someone else's Rights.

So, again that's the visualization exercise, there's three quick examples you have to envision: there's only two people. Would one person have a Right to conduct that action against another? If the answer is no, there is no such thing as calling it a Right and delegating it to other people and telling them “now you're allowed to perform that behavior.” It's always a Wrongdoing, but people because of this idea, this mind control called government, want to believe that that Right exists, that we can delegate something that is a Wrongdoing.
