## Responsibility

An individual's personal responsibility to choose right action over wrong action for themselves is always their own. One can only (falsely) claim that they are abdicating personal responsibility for such choice to someone else, it can never actually be done in reality. It's merely a claim when an order-follower says, “I am not personally responsible, because this person told me to do it” and what it actually truly is, is just a lie. More simply put...

::note
Every individual is **always responsible** for their own actions

>“Accept responsibility for yourself and your actions, thoughts, and words. You alone make choices. You alone are answerable to the consequences of your behavior. The feeble excuse that your boss required it, or the establishment expected it, holds no truth or justification.”

Lots of people erroneously believe that they can hand over their Natural Law right to defend themselves to another individual, or entity. In making such a false claim, they have attempted to abdicate a responsibility which always belongs to them, and can't be wholly given away.

### Part 224
RESPONSIBILITY VS. ABDICATION

### Part 225
Why don’t these people want to think for themselves? It’s too easy to just follow the orders of somebody else. They believe somehow magically this absolves them of personal responsibility to choose Right from Wrong. An individual’s personal responsibility to choose Right action over Wrong action for themselves always belongs to that individual. And that responsibility can never be given to another person or passed along. One can only claim and imagine that they can abdicate their personal responsibility for such choice to someone else. It can never actually be done in reality. you’re only making a claim “I’m not responsible for that behavior because this person told me to do it.” That’s just a claim, and more over what it really is, is just a damn lie. more simply put, an individual is always personally responsible for their own actions, period the end. If you did it, you’re responsible for it. There are no cop-outs. Stop trying to make excuses or justifications for criminal behavior. Own up to personal responsibility. If you did Wrong action, you did it, you caused it.


### Part 226
I like how David Icke words this; he said “accept responsibility for yourself and your actions, thoughts and words. You alone make these choices, so you alone are answerable for the consequences of your behavior. The feeble excuse that your boss required it, the establishment expected it, holds no truth or justification.”


### Part 227
“What is the point of having principles if you allow others to dictate your behavior?” Really, those who allow others to dictate their behavior don’t have principles. and there’s a reason they don’t have principles, it’s because they hate themselves. they’re in psychological self-loathing and there’s a reason they’re in that state, which my future work is going to cover in depth, in extensive depth and detail. “At the end of the day, you will judge your performance and the contribution you’ve made to Creation. It will not be based on what another expected of you, or what you did because you felt trapped.” Like oh there’s no other way, I can’t envision any other way out of this, I can’t envision doing something else, I might have to get another job, I might have to re-learn, I can’t envision becoming a different person from the identity I’ve already forged for myself, how could I possibly imagine that, I have all my eggs in this basket, my whole ego identity is all wrapped up in my job and what I do, that defines who I am, I can’t go against that. It’s all nonsense, it’s all what people are doing just because they feel trapped and they can’t imagine that there’s another way.


### Part 228
This is the second part of the abdication of responsibility on the part of the people. Most people erroneously believe they can “hand over” their Natural Law Right to defend themselves to another individual, group or entity. In making such a false claim that somebody else is my protector, somebody else; “it’s their responsibility to protect me and defend me,” they have attempted to abdicate a personal responsibility which actually always belongs to them, and can never be given away. That’s the self-defense principle, you own it, it’s yours. You can’t give it away to somebody else. Shock and amazement. that is your responsibility already, and guess what, you know what? These controllers are now even all too happy to say “it’s not our responsibility to protect you.” Because what their actual goal is, is they’re just revenue men for the new king. That’s all they (order-followers) are. And to slap people back into line if they try to exercise Rights that the new king called government has decreed that they may not exercise. That’s what the real world is. They don’t serve and protect the people, they serve and protect the ruling class, and they don’t want to admit that to themselves. You know why? Because they’re liars, most of all to themselves. It’s a bunch of childish liars


### Part 229
Franklin said “those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither and will lose both.” And this addresses the fear of chaos and the desire to abdicate your personal responsibility to defend yourself to other people just because you’re afraid and you don’t want to take the responsibility of doing it yourself. You want to stay in that mindset; “I give up the freedom to be safe,” well enjoy your safe slavery. I for one will take my dangerous and chaotic freedom. I’ll take the absolute cannibal lurking around every corner and I’ll take my chances, thank you very much. Give me my freedom and my assault rifle and I’ll take my chances thank you. So the idea that you just want to be kept safe and you’ll give up your freedom to do so, it’s just a child. That’s how a child thinks, and that’s what this is really about, not wanting to grow up and become adults.
