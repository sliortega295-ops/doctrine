### Part 193
THE ONE TRUE DIVIDE
so, what's the one true divide that exists in humanity? People say, “oh, it's this is separation talk, we're all one.” No, we're not. There is one true divide that does exist in reality.


### Part 194
And here's what it is: the one true divide that separates humanity into two distinct types of individuals. The criteria for this divide is whether or not an individual believes in “authority,” and therefore believes that there is legitimacy to slavery. The two groups of people are the people who know slavery is never legitimate, and people who believe that it can be legitimate. That's what actually separates humanity.


### Part 195
See all the other things: divide and conquer, race, religion, sex, sexuality, income, religious belief systems. These are all divide and conquer techniques. There's one real difference: whether somebody believes in slavery or not. And of course, people have called the difference: statists and anarchists.
so, here's a couple of memes that I picked up on Facebook. Statism is the brilliant idea that we give a small group of people the right to kidnap, imprison, harass, steal from and kill people, so that we can be protected from people who kidnap, harass, steal from and kill people. Yeah, that makes whole lot of sense if you ask me; I think it's going to work out brilliantly with that system in place. An anarchist- I couldn't find any good pictures of anarchists because they're all fake anarchists who want to destroy property and think that there's somehow doing the world some good. You know, the black block that are really communists in disguise. When you really boil down to it, they don't know what anarchy is at all. They're just some Marxists who think that junk ideology is some kind of a pathway to freedom. You know, it's a bunch of left-brain clowns who have no understanding of Natural Law. Go put your polka dot jumpsuit and some floppy shoes on and go get yourself a nice clown nose. Seriously, because that's what those people are, they're a joke. They're a joke. They don't know the first thing about what freedom is, not the first thing. So, I was looking for good pictures of anarchists. I was going to put like, you know, maybe myself, Larken Rose, Freeman, Frater X, people who get all the stuff, who I personally like their work. Michael Tsarion, et cetera, David Icke. But I said,
“Hey, let's put a meme up there that really expresses it.” So, I found this picture of Jesus, a meme that says “I'm an anarchist, but most of my followers are statists.”

people who are these fake ass Christians who believe they somehow are following the teachings of Christ? And they believe in government? They believe in financial institutions? They believe in organized religion? These are the three things that killed christ. If you even accept the historicity of the event. Who was Christ waging basic conflict with? The Pharisees and Sadducees, the organized religious order, and controlling religious orders on his day. What really got him in deep trouble, he was pissing them off, but they were already on the wane. The old world order was on the way out in the new world order was already on the way in that time. He got himself in real trouble when he went against the financial institutions, the moneychangers at the temple, taking people for a ride for temple coins, right? And he flogged their ass. He took out the switch on them, right? Not somebody who never got angry, who accepted evil and said, “oh, it's just an experience, you know, none of it matters.” Took out the switch and beat their ass for usury. And then who finally put him to death? The police of their day, the Roman Empire, you know, Roman centurions, the operating standing army and police of their day, the government. So, who was he waging spiritual warfare against to try to bring righteousness into the world? And again, I don't care whether you accepted it as historical fact or a spiritual allegory; I could care less, believe what you want. It doesn't matter. All that matters is the teaching. He was waging war, spiritual war against the three entrenched mind control religious establishments of his day: organized religion, organized finance, and government.

and people don't see it that way. So-called Christians, you know, cause they're not interested in the real teachings. They just want to call themselves something and identify it and say, “oh, that, that magically makes me this.” Because you go to church on sunday, doesn't make you a Christian. No more than going to a synagogue would make you align with the true teachings of the Torah. No more than attending a mosque would align you with the true teachings of Islam or any other religion, to take the core essence of the teachings of morality from those systems. They're all people who claim these faiths in name only when they don't understand real freedom.
