Not the ruling class, not the political "leader", or "masters", and not the so-called "elite", The people that keep the current slavery system in place, are the people who wilfully follow orders. Which can be a difficult truth to learn, and to accept for a lot of people.

## Following Orders
Following orders means doing what you are told to do, without judging for yourself whether or not the action you are being ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

If an individual is following orders, that individual can impossibly be exercising conscience, because by definition, exercising conscience means that one is wilfully choosing for themselves right action over wrong action.

Following orders should never be seen as a virtue of any kind; if you are acting based solely on what someone has told you to do, there is no morality found in that, whatsoever. There is no such thing as morally following orders, the two terms are contradictory.

Therefore, "I was just following order", is never a valid excuse or justification for immoral, harmful behavior. This sorry attempt to give up personal responsibility should never be accepted as a valid excuse for such behavior.

## Unconscious Behavior
The order-follower tries to abdicate their personal responsibility for their actions and pretend the blame lies with the order giver; which is an obvious lie (to themselves, mainly). They could look you dead in the eye and say "I'm not responsible for that. I just did it; but I'm not the person who's responsible for it, because I was acting on orders from somebody else",

It's astonishing that they somehow truly seem to believe that statement can be regarded as true, in any way. Sadly, lots of people nowadays believe that there is legitimacy to this immoral behavior because a group of people calling themselves 'government' have somehow been imbued and gifted with such "rights",

The people in government believe they have rights that others don't; but what's even worse is that the people who are actually affected by their immoral behavior, they believe it too.

## Transcript

### Part 211
Order-followers, these are the people who keep the system of slavery in place. They are the people who keep this system of slavery in place. Let me just say that again; order- followers are the people who keep the existence of slavery in place. Not the ruling class, not the masters, not the so-called elite, which aren’t the elite of anything but the bottom of a trashcan. The people who keep slavery in place are the people who willfully follow their orders. Nobody wants to hear that, and people will hate you for saying it.


### Part 212
Following orders means by definition: doing what you are told to do without judging for yourself whether or not that action that you are being ordered to carry out is actually Right or Wrong. That’s the definition of following orders. Can anybody refute that? Is that not the actual definition of following someone else’s order? By definition if you’re following the order given, you just act; you just do it because you’re following the order. You don’t sit there and go; “is what that person told me to do Right, do I have a right to do that, is that moral, should I do that because it’s ok and it doesn’t hurt somebody else, or should I not do that because it actually does cause harm?” It’s not what an order follower does in their mind, an order follower says “yes sir” and follows the order. That’s why it’s called an order follower. That’s why it’s called following an order. So that’s the definition of what an order follower is, it’s not my perception of what an order follower is, it’s the actual definition of order following.


### Part 213
This is key to understand. If an individual is performing the task of following orders, by definition that individual can not be exercising conscious. Since, by definition, exercising conscious means that one is willfully choosing through their free will for themselves Right action over Wrong action. So the concept of following orders is completely polar opposite to the concept of exercising conscience. You cannot be doing the same things simultaneously; it’s impossible to do those two things simultaneously. They are contradictions in terms by definition. Most people don’t grasp that. By definition if you’re following orders you cannot be actually exercising conscious, which involves freewill choice based on the knowledge of Right and Wrong.


### Part 214
Here’s what order-following gets us as far as a nation is concerned, not that we’re already there, not that these people already didn’t take us because we’re taken by them already, covertly. They took us through the school systems, they couldn’t beat us militarily, so they said “well let’s send our ideologues over there and get into the minds of their children.” And if you don’t believe that’s what happened, you are very very very naïve. Not only the Nazis but the communists as well, because really it’s all just forms of socialism. That’s what feudalism is. Worldwide socialism is “there’s no such thing as private property.” The State owns everything, Rights don’t exist, property Rights don’t exist, everybody’s a feudal serf again. It’s called neo feudalism. I don’t care which branch you come at it from; you want to come at it from the left, that’s called communism, you want to come at it from the right, that’s called national socialism; communism international socialism. They’re both the same force; it’s called feudalism. let’s just call it what it is; it’s called feudalism, which is in it of itself just another euphemism for slavery. They want neo feudalism, which is the new world order of slavery, and it’s already here, it’s not something that’s coming, it’s here now. The object is to get out of it.


### Part 215
This is the result of following orders; that’s what following orders get us as a society. Following orders should never be seen as a virtue. Following orders is evil. I don’t care if somebody who is considered a holy man gives an order and I follow it, I just committed an act of evil as far as I’m concerned. If I’m acting based solely on what somebody else has told me to do, that’s evil. There’s no morality in it at all. At all, at all. it’s not a virtue, it’s evil. Let me just make that so abundantly clear and state it so unequivocally; there’s no such thing as any possible moral following of orders. The two terms are contradictory, alright.


### Part 216
“I was just following orders” is never a valid excuse or justification for immoral, criminal behavior, and this lame attempt to advocate personal responsibility should never be accepted as a valid excuse for such behavior.


### Part 217
Why it’s done is through justification, and again that means to create a right. From jus, meaning Right or law, and the Latin verb facere , which means to make or to create. And this is what they say, “I was just following orders, I was just doing my job, I was shutting down your protests, you don’t have a Right to speak, the politicians commanded me so. So I just came out, I was just doing my job; hitting you with a sound cannon. Just doing my job, just my following orders.” It’s a justification. You’re a criminal. There’s nothing moral in that, there’s nothing virtuous in that. It’s called criminal behavior, criminal activity. And what they do is try to create it into a Right, make it into a Right by a justification. And nobody should ever accept their justifications because you know what their justifications are? It’s called a 100% crock of bull that is a complete lie. It’s a lie. They’re just straight up looking me in the face and saying “I’m not responsible for that, I just did it but I’m not the one who’s responsible for it because I was acting on orders.” Well see this defense didn’t work as the Nuremberg defense and nobody in America should be accepting it. Nobody in America should be accepting it because they believe in the legitimacy of authority and government through mind control. they believe it, they believe there’s legitimacy to it. Most people actually believe that there’s legitimacy to this criminal behavior because a class of people calling themselves government have magically been imbued and gifted with “such rights.” They believe they have Rights other people don’t. They themselves believe it, but worse is that the people who are actually affected by that criminal behavior, they believe they (order followers) have the authority to do it.


### Part 218
Gandhi said “you assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul.” Which means saying no.
