title: Teachability
description: A person's teachability, or their ability to learn by being taught by another, is extremely dependent upon the open-mindedness or closed-mindedness of the person being taught.
---

## Low Teachability
Low teachability derives from arrogance and rigid skepticism, but also from naiveté and gullibility.

## High Teachability
High teachability derives from a balance between healthy skepticism and an open- minded willingness to learn, and more importantly, the willingness to change.

## Consider Your Sources
People should consider with great care their sources for information. Because by refusing to present certain information, and by influencing people to dismiss certain information as unimportant or unnecessary to consider, many modern institutions (like the mainstream media, or so-called “educational” institutions) seek to control human perceptions, and by doing so, limit what human beings may come to understand. By limiting what a person is able to understand, a person is automatically limited in what they are able to do, what they are able to change, and what they are able to create.

So again, you should not just believe anything you read here.
You need to look into the information written about in this guide for yourself, and most importantly, personal  introspection is necessary; to really feel within whether or not this information resonates with  truth. Every person has that intuitive capacity to a certain degree.

First section is about teachability, the teach-ability of the student. How does a student place themself in the best position to learn.

An individual's teachability, or their ability to learn by way of being taught by someone else, is extremely dependent upon the open-mindedness or closed-mindedness of the individual being taught. Low teachability derives from arrogance and ridged skepticism. But low teachability also derives from naïveté and gullibility.

High teachability on the other hand, derives from a balance between healthy skepticism and an open-minded willingness to learn and change. So we don't want rigidly skeptical people that don't have an open mind at all and we don't want naïve and gullible people that will accept everything they're told. We want to strike a balance between these two modes.

This is called a teachability bell curve. Down here (bottom horizontal line under the bell curve) is the mental state of the student and it goes from arrogance, cynicism, skeptical nature, a teacher, a student, and then up to trusting, then being gullible and then being outright naïve. That's the whole spectrum of teachability. The best position to learn is up here at the top of the bell curve. This means you will learn the most if you are here and that means you're in the balance between teacher and student. It means that you're somewhat skeptical and you are also somewhat trusting. It means that you're able to hold a proposition in your mind without accepting it or rejecting it immediately.

It means you will consider the information with an open mind, somewhat trustingly, but also somewhat skeptically. That's going to be the mental state we want to attempt to keep during the duration of this seminar and therefore you will be in the best position to learn. Of course, as we've already said, the poorest positions to learn, if you're in these mind states in arrogance and ridged skepticism and naïveté and gullibility, you're not going to take very much away from this seminar. So we want to remain at the top of that bell curve if at all possible.

Human beings should consider with great care, where their information comes from, the source for the information. And this is because by refusing to present certain information and by influencing people to dismiss, to dissuade them from looking in to certain information, because they are telling you that it's unimportant or unnecessary to consider, many modern institutions, like media, like so-called education institutions are seeking to actually control human perceptions, or let's call it outright what it really is, to control the mind. And therefore to limit what human beings may even come to understand and therefore by limiting what they are coming to understand, they're actually limiting what they're able to do, what they are able to change, what they are able to create in the world.

You have to be skeptical of where your information comes from and that's why I tell people at the very beginning in my lectures; do not believe me. The worst thing you could do is believe what I'm telling you. You need to look into it for yourself and most of all you need to do personal introspection to really feel inside of yourself whether this information resonates with truth. Everybody has that intuitive capacity- that also has to be turned on and engaged and used.

If anybody is coming to this seminar from the perspective of modern organized institutional bodies, meaning: political thought, political agendas, political organizations, religion, religious thought, religious organizations. I'm talking about organized religion here. What I call scientism- not real science, but scientism: science as set up by institutional bodies to be rigidly skeptical belief systems that blot out anything that could possibly say anything to the contrary of their pre-existing beliefs. I call that scientism. And of course the new age movement, which you could group that in with religion.

It's for those who don't fall into the religious mindset, this is an alternative religion proposed for them and they call it the new age movement. And I tell people, “please, don't think this is going to concur with any of these belief systems, with any of these boxes for consciousness.” This presentation is going to shatter these boxes. It stands outside of all of these, because these are limiters for perception and thought. They want to place everything in a box, say nothing outside of this box is fit for human consumption, so do not go there, and as a result they act as a mind control influence.

The other, and biggest limiter of human perceptions and the mind, and ultimately of our behavior, is money itself.

You want to talk about the biggest religion, if these other religions aren't big enough and powerful enough for you, there's the one that is the ultimate power in the world, the ultimate religion, the god of this world if you will.

So what I'm basically saying here is if you're already in a mind set approaching the, let's call it the discovery of reality, or the exploration of reality from any of these perspectives, you'll be sorely disappointed here today by what you are going to hear because the information here falls well outside any of these institutional limiters for consciousness.
