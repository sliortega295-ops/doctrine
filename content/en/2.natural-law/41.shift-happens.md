## Quantum Shift
A 'Quantum Shift' in human consciousness is required for humanity to become free of its self-imposed state of slavery.

Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. Anybody who thinks that's the case is very naïve, overly positive, and in some form of right-brain imbalance. Whether or not this shift will occur mainly relies on the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves enormous effort, dedication, and persistence. We cannot give up.

There is a saying in Alchemy that has been referred to as the "catchphrase of the alchemical tradition", the saying goes: **_Labore et constantia_** which means "Work and constancy". Constant effort is going to be required to get this boulder up the mountain, and in the condition in which humanity finds itself today, it will most likely go kicking and screaming.

Teaching Natural Law to others is not an easy task, it usually isn't fun, and we're definitely not going to get it done in a day. Therefore, we are going to have to continually work hard on this matter, or the quantum shift simply will not happen at all.

## Requirements

A Quantum Shift Has Requirements. The word quantum is derived from the (same) Latin noun **_Quantum_** which means "Amount". In order to tip the scales of truth and justice back into balance, a certain amount of people actually need to be doing the Great Work of helping other people to receive this knowledge of Natural Law. Simply put, higher amounts of people are required.

Individual behavioral choices, either based in harmony or in opposition to Natural Law, combine in energy and effect, and in the aggregate, influence the quality of the manifested shared human experience; we collectively create our shared experience. This dynamic acts as a perfect expression of the principle of Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above." Decisively contrary to the "New age" view.

## Transcript

### Part 241
Shift happens. Well, maybe, but maybe not. The result’s not guaranteed here folks. The new-agers want to tell you it’s all guaranteed, it’s all in hand. The Zeta reticulians are going to be coming in from orbit at any moment here; give us all the secrets to the universe, save us from our own ignorance, you know. You just got to wait a few more years or decades or millennia, but they’ll be here soon. A quantum shift in human consciousness is required for humanity to become free of its self-imposed state of slavery. Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. We could be in this condition for a very very very very long time. Or it can snowball and lead to total annihilation and the extinction of the human species. The positive outcome is not guaranteed. Anybody who thinks it is, is very naïve and extraordinarily right brained and overly positive. I’m not telling you the negative outcome is guaranteed either. I’m telling you it can go either way depending on how consciousness goes, how many people in quantum numbers are going to choose truth over deception. That’s what’s going to determine the outcome. Whether or not it will occur is a function of the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves enormous effort, enormous dedication, and most of all, enormous persistence.

you can’t give up. Continuous application of will is required. Continuous work. In alchemy there’s a saying, it’s like the catchphrase for the alchemical tradition: labore et constantia. It means work and constancy. Continual effort. That’s what going to get this boulder up the mountain. That’s it, and it’s gonna go kicking and screaming folks, because of the level of calcification the human mind is at. I don’t expect this to be an easy process. I’m not blowing smoke up your rear end and telling; “hey come over and do the Great Work, it’s going to be so much fun, it’s going to be so easy, we’re going to get it done real quick, and everything’s going to be fine.” If I was some new age guru who was trying to get you all to believe what I’m saying, that’s what I would tell you because all I would be worried about is how popular I am how many followers I can accrue. I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in telling you how it really is. That doesn’t make me popular. As a matter of fact that makes me hated by a lot of people, ok. this is not going to be easy.

### Part 242
A quantum shift has requirements. The word quantum is derived from the latin noun quantum. It’s the same word in Latin as it is in English. Quantum in Latin means an amount of something. In order to tip the scales of truth and justice back to balance, a certain amount of people actually need to be doing the Great Work to help others to receive Truth. If we don’t have enough people doing that, those scales are not going to tip in the opposite direction. Got news for you, we need to hit a critical mass number. Numbers are required. The new age movement wants to tell you “no, numbers aren’t required. A tiny tiny tiny portion can make great great great change happen.” nonsense. It’s not called a quantum shift for no reason. It’s called a quantum shift because quantum means an amount. You need to put enough force on that scale to get the truth to tip in the other direction. If you don’t have that amount, it’s not going to tip.


### Part 243
So, individual behavioral choices, either based on harmony with Natural law, or opposition to Natural Law. They combine in their energy and effect, and in the aggregate, meaning in the sum total, they influence the quality of the manifested shared human experience. That’s how reality is created. Very contradictory to the new age notion, each individual is not creating their own reality. In the aggregate humanity is co- creating the collective shared experience that we are all undergoing. We collectively create our shared experience, not each individual creates the reality that everybody experiences. Yea you do create a microcosmic aspect of how you experience your life, whether you’re experiencing self-inflicted suffering in large amounts of it or not. That’s the laws of attraction work on an individuated level, but at a mass level, they work in the aggregate. We need a population who understands and lives in harmony with Natural law and numbers are required for that to happen. This dynamic acts as a perfect expression of the Principle of Correspondence: as above, so below, as below, so above. as the individuated units of consciousness are co-creating reality, so the macrocosmic reality shall become and shall be experienced. Decisively contrary to the new age view, in order for a quantum shift to take place, numbers are required.
