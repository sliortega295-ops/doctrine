## 1. Love / Fear

**Positive:**    
The positive aspect of the Generative Polarity is **_Love_**. In regard to Natural Law,
love should be seen as the expansive force for consciousness. Love is the force which helps us become open to truth, and expand our awareness.  

**Negative:**    
The negative aspect of the generative polarity is **_Fear_**. In regard to Natural Law, fear should be seen as the contractive force for consciousness. Fear is the force which influences us to become closed to truth, and the force which ultimately shuts down our awareness.

## 2. Knowledge / Ignorance

**Positive:**  
The positive aspect of the Initiating Expression is **_Knowledge_**,or the acceptance of truth. Knowledge of truth positively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.  

**Negative:**  
The negative aspect of the initiating expression is **_Ignorance_**, or the refusal of truth. Ignorance negatively influences the quality of our lives because it negatively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.

::note
It is important to remember that "Ignorance" should be distinguished from "Nescience". Nescience means not knowing something because necessary information is not present, or unattainable. Ignorance, on the other hand, means not knowing something even though necessary information is present, because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.

“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what
never was and never will be.” - Thomas Jefferson, 3rd president of the U.S.A.

“The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance.”
- Socrates, Greek philosopher

<hr class="my-8 border-b"></span>

## 3. Sovereignty / Confusion

**Positive:**  
The positive aspect of the Internal Expression is **_Sovereignty_**, or what is also referred to as **Internal Monarchy** (one ruler within). 

The word "Monarchy" is made up of the prefix **_Mon-_** derived from the Greek adverb **_Mons_** (μόνα) which means "One, Single, or Alone" and the Greek noun **_Archon_** (αρχων) which means "Master, Lord, or Ruler". Therefore, Monarchy means "One Ruler".

::note
As a state of consciousness, sovereignty means that one has unified the three aspects of their consciousness, in the way that there is no contradiction between one's thoughts, emotions, and actions.
::

The word "Sovereign" is derived from the Latin adverb **_Super_** which means "Above, or Beyond" (In classical Latin the **_V_** character represented a **_U_**, hence the letter "W" is called a "double U". The "V-sound" didn't phonetically exist in classical Latin, instead the "V" was represented by the letters "P" or "B"). The second half stems from the word **_Regnum_** which means "Reign, Rulership, or (externally imposed) Control, or Kingship". Thus, the word "Sovereign" means: "One who is above the rulership or control of another". Therefore, the word sovereign means "not a slave". Being sovereign means being a monarch (**_Mon-_**: "One", **_Archon_**: "Ruler"), a single ruler who rules only the "kingdom of self". Sovereignty is a state of being in which one controls one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions, and by bringing them into Unity, Non-Contradiction, Non-Duality, attains mastery of one's own consciousness. Self-Control is Self-Mastery is Self-Ownership.

**Negative:**  
The negative aspect of the internal expression is **_Confusion_**, or what is also referred to as **Internal Anarchy** (no ruler within). Confusion is the state of mind in which the being is ruled by fear and ignorance. Confusion can be seen as internal opposition, in such a way that one's thoughts, emotions, and actions are in perpetual contradiction with one another; the three are not in alignment. As we think is not how we truly feel, and is not how we act. There is complete contradiction and separation internally, when there is no unity amongst these three aspects of our consciousness.

<hr class="my-8 border-b"></span>

## 4. Freedom / Control

**Positive:**  
The positive aspect of the External Expression is 'Freedom,' or what is also
referred to as 'External Anarchy' (no external ruler). True freedom for all beings
should be seen as the ultimate goal of spiritual development. And such a state can only
manifest as a result of human society's adherence to Natural Law.

**Negative:**  
The negative aspect of the external expression is 'Control,' or what is referred to as
External Monarchy (one external ruler). For example, the concentration of illusory
power by a king, or by institutions like government.
Externally imposed control is the pathway to all forms of evil and destruction. It
results when a society lives in direct opposition to Natural Law.

<hr class="my-8 border-b"></span>

## 5. Order / Chaos

**Positive:**  
The positive Manifestation is 'Order,' or manifested good. Order represents
everything we truly want to manifest. Order results only when there is balance and
justice; which can only be present when truth has been accepted, and our behavior
has been brought into harmony with Natural Law.

**Negative:**  
The negative manifestation is 'Chaos,' or manifested evil. Chaos is the exact
opposite of what we truly want to manifest. Chaos occurs when there is imbalance and
injustice, which results whenever there is ignorance of truth, and behavior which is in
opposition to Natural Law.

<hr class="my-12 border-b-4"></span>

description: All five expressions of Natural Law are unilateral, meaning they do not cross over into one another.

Therefore, there is no way you could accept truth and develop knowledge, and then end up in a state of confusion. Just as you cannot go from ignorance to sovereignty. The Natural Law expressions simply don't work that way.

::note
If you keep waiting on an external saviour, you are going to be waiting in your chains forever.
::

Even the modern Christ-figure himself proclaimed that the knowledge of truth would be the only pathway to true freedom. Until you take in the light, you will never dispel the darkness. The light being knowledge of truth; which is what 'light' has always symbolized and represented in the bible, and in numerous other ancient mystery traditions. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.” - John 1:5

## Transcript

### Part 98
this is the heart of the presentation here: It's how Natural Law actually works in our lives. What are its expressions, how can we come to understand how this operates? there are ways of knowing, and they're through these expressions of Natural Law. So, we define what Natural Law is, we talked about the underlying principles that it's based upon, now we're going to talk about how it works in our lives. So, we're gonna build a chart of Natural Law expressions in a moment.

### Part 99
What these expressions are, are the recognizable workings in our life. And they take place through 5 basic expressions. Each of the 5 expressions of Natural Law have a positive aspect and a negative aspect. So that gives us a total of 10 overall Natural law expressions, and we're gonna build a chart regarding these expressions.

### Part 100
So, here's the expression, and then there's a positive aspect to the expression, and there is a negative aspect to the expression. The first expression of Natural Law is known as, and again, this is what I call these things, there’s no hardened fast rules, it's just terminology. It's jargon to try to explain them in words. These are unseen concepts and laws in reality, in nature, in the nature of the universe. These are just English word terms that I'm applying to these concepts.

The first principle of Natural Law I call the Generative Polarity. Or in other words, this is the force or energy that we are using at the base level to start the process of creation, or you could say, of co-creation. We're co-creating the reality that we experience with the Laws of Nature. You could look at the first expression of Natural law, which is the Generative Polarity, as the force that we use to set all of the other events which are to come, which are to manifest in our lives, into motion. Or in other
words, what we use, the force that we use to generate or create the quality of our experience. That's The Generative Polarity.

The positive expression of The Generative Polarity is LOVE. Now, this is not what many people think of as love. It's not familial love, it's not relationship love, it's not Hollywood movie variant of love, it's the not romance novel variant of love. I call love: consciousness. Love is the force which helps us to expand consciousness and become open to truth if we are in it, if we are in that vibratory energy, we become open to truth.

### Part 101
So, here's what it looks like visually. I try to put a visual aspect to all of these concepts. And people would think that I'm going to put 2 people together kissing or hugging or something like that. Love is inside each individual if it is present, it doesn't depend on any other person. You can express love with another person, and there's no problem with that, I'm not saying that's a bad thing, that's a great thing if it's present in your life. The capital L, capital O, capital V, capital E definition of LOVE that I'm giving here is not that; it is this force that opens up our consciousness. It's the flowering expression of consciousness.

### Part 102
So, how I word this is: the positive aspect of the generative polarity, the first expression of Natural law, is LOVE. In regard to Natural Law, Love should be seen as the expansive force for consciousness; it is the force which helps us to become open to truth and expand our awareness. That's the connotation that I'm giving for the concept called LOVE here.

### Part 103
That's the positive expression of the creative polarity. Now, the negative expression of the creative polarity is the exact opposite of LOVE. So, people will automatically think, “oh, that's hate,” and it is not. Because the thing that puts consciousness in a box and prevents it from growing and keeps it where it's at is what?

(Audience response) there it is: FEAR. FEAR is the basis for unconsciousness. You cannot be unconscious of anything in particular unless you fear it. that's what shuts consciousness down, and here's my visual for it.

### Part 104
FEAR: “I don't want to look at that,” “that's too horrible for me to contemplate,” “that can't be true,” “I don't want that to be true.” That's all FEAR.

### Part 105
The negative aspect of The Generative Polarity is FEAR. FEAR is the contractive force for consciousness. FEAR is the force which influences us to become closed to the Truth, and it is the force which ultimately shuts down our awareness. That's why so many people are unconscious because they are fearful. They are fearful of the responsibility that comes with knowledge, and most of all they are fearful of having to act based upon knowledge because that requires courage.

### Part 106
The second Natural Law expression is The Initiating Expression, what I call the Initiating Expression, just my term for it. The Initiating Expression is the first stage
of tangible and recognizable results, which we produce in our lives after we have “set the ball rolling,” set the dynamic in motion. By choosing between The Generative Polarities of either LOVE or FEAR. So, we choose LOVE, and something starts to happen; we become open to Truth. Well, LOVE is the expansive force for consciousness that opens our minds to the Truth and awareness. So, what do we gain as a result of accepting or existing in the vibratory energy called LOVE?

We gain KNOWLEDGE. Which is the acceptance of Truth. Since LOVE opens us up to Truth, KNOWLEDGE is its reception; it is the receiving of Truth we come to know. That's how it starts; I call this The Initiating Expression. Now, of course, there is a negative initiating expression if we are existing in the vibratory dynamic of fEAR, that would be the opposite of knowledge. What is it? IGNORANCE, that's right.

### Part 107
This is what I put forward as KNOWLEDGE; this is my imagery for kNOWLEDGE. That's a being who knows themself, and as the mystery traditions of greece put forward at the Delphic Oracle, “know the self, and you will know the universe,” in other words, know the microcosm, and you will know the macrocosm. know thyself.

### Part 108
The positive aspect of this initiating expression is KNOWLEDGE or the acceptance of TRUTH. KNOWLEDGE positively influences the quality of our lives because it positively influences our decision-making processes that lead to understanding in every area of our lives. You wanna know how something works and ultimately create something good? You have to have KNOWLEDGE. You wanna know how a car works and keep it running in good order? You have to have KNOWLEDGE. You wanna know how a computer works and keep it running in good order? You have to have kNOWLEDGE. You wanna know how the human psyche works and keep it running in good order, so that the conditions on earth manifest the way you want them to manifest? you gotta have KNOWLEDGE. We're not getting out of this condition without learning. learning is the key, it's the answer. KNOWLEDGE is the answer, and people don't want to hear that. They don't want to hear it. They want to think we're magically gonna manifest the desired conditions that we say we want without learning a thing. It doesn't work that way.

### Part 109
So again, the negative Initiating Expression is IGNORANCE; iGNORANCE is the refusal of Truth; it is the refusal to gain KNOWLEDGE because we are in FEAR.

### Part 110
So here’s what I put as the image for IGNORANCE. The population that is hypnotized: that wants to pay attention to nonsense and trivialities, feed themselves tons of GMO food that is crap for the physiology, pay attention to distraction, entertainment, mainstream news and media. It's all there to just shut the consciousness down and keep people in a depressed psychological state and keep them in a state of psychological infancy.

### Part 111
The negative aspect of The Initiating Expression of Natural Law is
iGNORANCE or the refusal of Truth. IGNORANCE negatively influences the quality of our lives because it negatively influences these decision-making processes that lead to understanding in every area of our lives. If you're ignorant about how anything works, you can't create the desired condition. It's just not possible.

### Part 112
It's important to remember again, that ignorance should be distinguished from nescience, which means not knowing because necessary information is not present or was unattainable. IGNORANCE, on the other hand, means not knowing even though necessary information is present because that information has been willfully refused or disregarded. And again, to keep us in IGNORANCE, they don't need to hide the information anymore, because it's not hidden anymore, it's out, and once again, it's available at your fingertips for free, if you have the desire to take it in. But, now the manipulation mechanism that is used is: dissuade people from looking at it. Provide endless entertainment, provide endless amusement, provide endless distraction and say that “there's nothing to any of that stuff, that's just some old crazy religion that you don't need to understand, it no different than any other religion, believing that Natural Law exists.” That's what people will insist on telling you. So, people will be dissuaded from ever looking into it and they’ll disregard it of their own choice.

### Part 113
Thomas Jefferson said that “if a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.” Freedom and ignorance are the antithesis of each other that can never co-exist simultaneously. That is an impossibility in Natural Law. I'm gonna put up another couple quotes on ignorance.

### Part 114
Samuel Adams said “no people will tamely surrender their liberties, nor can any be easily subdued when knowledge is diffused,” that means it's everywhere present
“and virtue is preserved,” meaning morality. “On the contrary, when people are universally ignorant and debauched in their manners” meaning purely selfish and only worried about themselves “they will sink under their own weight without the aid of foreign invaders” meaning the society will turn inward upon itself and collapse and destroy itself just based on the fact alone that the population is ignorant and they're ensconced in moral relativism and other forms of debauchery and just self-pleasure as their highest virtue, their highest desire.

### Part 115
Socrates said that “the only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance.”

### Part 116
And this is a quote that I'd like to be remembered for: “willful ignorance in the presence of knowledge is the measure of a bad person.” People will say that's extremely harsh, and that’s true, that doesn't make the statement untrue. The statement is true as well. It is a harsh statement.
see, people in my family will ask me, “why won't you have anything to do with me anymore?” I've deliberately cut off many members of my own family, because many members of my family say, “I know what's going on and I don't care, I don't intend to do a damn thing about it. I'm worried about me, myself and mine, and I don't care what's
happening in the world.” Well, you know what that's called folks? That's called a bad person. Let's not mince words, let's not euphemize, let's call it what it is. That's called a bad person. And I don't want anything to do with bad people in my personal life; I don't hang out with bad people. I try to surround myself with good people who care because they're creating, co-creating wisely. I tell family members who I've cut off association with “because you do not care, is what makes you a bad person. I don't want anything to do with you until you start caring about what's going on in the world, then we could talk again. And I'll welcome you back with open arms and forgive you, but not until. You want to stay in that level of consciousness; I want nothing to do with you.” I don't want to be around people like that. They're bad influences, and they do bring other people down. So, I'll still put out the information, it's there anytime, for free, that they want to go and engage it. And I tell them all; “any time you want to ask me and come over and directly engage with me, I'll make the time for you. But until you want to do that, until you develop that desire, I don't want to be in your presence.” So, I don't know if that's going to be effective, I don't know. And guess what? I don't care whether it's going to be effective because I'm not going to surround myself with bad people until they decide, “I want to make myself a better person,” then I'll engage them and speak the truth to them. but until then, I'll put this out there for all, for free, and they can engage it anytime they want. But in my personal life, I can't make time for that; I don't have energy for that. I barely have energy for this.

### Part 117
An anonymous quote, I believe this was from some internet forum, I don't know what the gentleman's name was, but it's a great quote; “ignorance is the root cause of all evil. And since only knowledge eradicates ignorance, it is our duty and moral obligation” -there's that term- “to educate ourselves, as well as the masses around us.” that's a moral obligation if you're in a position of knowledge. And once again, that's why I do what I do; I don't do it because I like people, believe me, Barb will tell you how much I like people. I don't do it to make friends. I don't do it to make money. I do it because it's a moral obligation and for no other reason. I don't serve people; I serve truth. Truth is the force which I serve, and I bend the knee to no other. That's it, that's it. so, great few quotes on ignorance.

### Part 118
Let's look at the next expression; The Internal Expression is what happens inside of us, very simply. So, now, we've started creating with a polarity, something has happened in the world, either acceptance of Truth or refusal of Truth. Now, something’s going to take place inside of us. So look (at the slide), this level is that KNOWLEDGE level. This is the base consciousness level. You could look at that, that's the foundation, remember that 4-block diagram (Slide 65)? You could look at this, here's the foundation. this is the foundation that lies underneath the Trivium. That's as deep as it gets, consciousness or unconsciousness, LOVE or FEAR. That's what everything is a choice between. Now here’s that first block. KNOWLEDGE or lack thereof. KNOWLEDGE or IGNORANCE. You can see these polarities are like that concept of, in, Polarity aspect of the Natural Law Principles; there's one thing that's real, and then there's the illusion. these are two aspects of the same thing. This is consciousness, and this is its lack. This is acceptance of Truth, and this is the lack of that. So there, this is the same thing but opposite in degree, which is why they're the same expression. Now, what happened after
kNOWLEDGE or lack thereof? We went up to understanding. So, that's what this level is. Understanding happens internally; it's an internal process.

The positive aspect of The Internal Expression is when we come to understand through developing the knowledge and the acceptance of Truth that we are sovereign. SOVEREIGNTY is the expression, the internal positive expression of Natural law. Now again, underneath these in parenthesis, I always put what I call these things, another name that I've given to these things, these concepts. I call SOVEREIGNTY: internal monarchy. Internal monarchy. Now, monarchy means one ruler. Mon - means one, is a prefix for one, and archon in Greek means ruler or master. So, internally we each need to master and rule ourselves. This is our kingdom that we get to rule and nowhere else, we don't get to rule over anybody else. Many people think they're the rulers of other people, but they're Wrong. Each of us is a sovereign being. sOVEREIGNTY as we're going to see means that you're not owned by anyone else; no one else owns you if you are sovereign.

### Part 119
So, here's my expression, my visualization for SOVEREIGNTY: somebody who truly has the light. They have the light at their disposal; they’re bathed in it, it's flowing within them. And light has always been associated in different mystery traditions as knowledge. It has been a symbol that has represented knowledge. This is the person who has the knowledge and has gone through the decision making and filtering processes with that knowledge to come to an internal understanding that they are a SOVEREIGN being. And I have news for everybody: whether you know it or not, whether you are familiar with the term or not, every person here is a sovereign, and you can never not be. It is an impossibility for you to ever be non-sovereign; it cannot be done. Cannot be done in nature. Every single human being on this planet is a sovereign being. And we're going to look at what SOVEREIGNTY actually means.

### Part 120
The positive aspect of The Internal Expression is SOVEREIGNTY, or what i call internal monarchy, meaning “one ruler within.” Internal monarchy: one ruler within. As a state of consciousness, SOVEREIGNTY means that one has unified the 3 aspects of their consciousness, such that there is no internal contradiction between one’s thoughts, emotions and actions. We become a being that as we think, so we feel, so we speak and act, and there's no contradiction between those. We're not torn apart from within, in this state of eternal opposition amongst our own consciousness.

### Part 121
Moreover, let's break the word sovereign down, that's where we're going to come to the real meaning of the term. Sovereign is derived from the Latin adverb super , super means above. See, in classical Latin, there's no V in classical Latin; there's no V character. Actually, if you wrote a V like that (makes gesture) it was a U, and why a W looks the way it is, it's 2 V's actually, but that sound was U in Latin if you see a V. there’s no “vuh” sound in classical Latin, it doesn't exist phonetically. So, this phonetic
variation that we express as V or “vuh” in English, in Latin, was P or B; it was represented by a P or by a B. So, what we're really seeing here is “suver,” suver. But it was pronounced in Latin as super, like super_._ Well, what does super mean? Super, you're beyond, you're above and beyond. It means above or beyond, that's what it means.
a superman is one who is beyond an ordinary man.
the Latin noun regnum comprises the second part of the etymological root of this word. regnum comes from rex. Rex, regis in Latin, or regis means king. So, regnum was the kings' rulership. Regnum means his reign; it's where the word reign comes from in english, regnum in Latin. It means rulership or externally imposed control. Not control in the context of “I'm gonna control my emotions, I'm going to control my behavior.” no, it means “I'm going to control you externally by imposing my will over your will through coercion.” That's the context of rulership or control that I'm talking about here.
so, put them together, super-regnum : sovereign, means above or beyond externally imposed rulership or control by another. That's what it means. SOVEREIGN means not a subject to another being like a king, like one who considers himself a king, and it means not a slave to someone who considers themself to be your master.

That's all sovereign means folks, not a slave. And why I say “every single person here is a sovereign, is because there is no such thing, never has been any such thing, and never will be such thing as legitimacy to slavery.” That has never existed, does not exist now, and never will exist. Slavery is an illegitimate concept. None of us are slaves. The condition of slavery has been imposed upon people, but it has never in history been legitimate, and it never will in history be legitimate.
so, there is no legitimacy to the concept of slavery, of the rightful rulership of another being through directly imposing your control through coercion. Doesn't exist; that's a big part of what Natural Law is about. We have to understand; when we're saying this word, this is what is meant by sovereign: not a slave. We did a study where we asked people,
“are you a sovereign?” Like 11% said yes, maybe, I think it was like 10 or 11%, which I thought was almost encouraging that 1 in 10 people knew that they were sovereign beings, it was amazing. But 90% of the human population doesn't feel that they're sovereign, doesn't know that they're sovereign. I'm telling you, it doesn't matter an iota whether you believe you are or not, I'm telling you it's an eternal truth that you are a sovereign and that you can never non-sovereign. There is no such thing as someone else’s legitimate rulership or ownership of you. Because there is no such thing to the legitimacy of slavery and there never has been, and there never will be.

### Part 122
So, everyone is a sovereign. A sovereign is a monarch, again , mon - means one , archon means ruler. So, when people ask me what kind of government do I want, I tell them I want anarchy, and I want monarchy. And they're like, “how could you have those things simultaneously?” Because if you have internal monarchy, you can have external anarchy. See, we need to have the rulership within, and we need to get rid of the rulership without. This is the kingdom we need to master and we need to set aside the concept of mastery and slavery in the external domain, in the physical world. A sovereign is a monarch, a single ruler who rules only the kingdom of self. sOVEREIGNTY is a state in which one controls one's own thoughts, emotions and actions, and by bringing them into unity, or non-contradiction, or non-duality, attains mastery of one's own consciousness. SOVEREIGNTY could be considered the
equivalent of true self-control, true self-mastery, true self-love, or true self-ownership. it's all of these things, and ultimately it means not a slave, that's what has to be remembered above all else.

### Part 123
Let's look at the negative Internal Expression of Natural Law, which is cONFUSION. Now, CONFUSION results when we are in IGNORANCE. That's the emotional dynamic, the feeling that takes place within the individual. This is the lack of understanding; CONFUSION only happens in a lack of understanding. When we have not taken in KNOWLEDGE, because we are afraid, we are in FEAR, IGNORANCE results, and then CONFUSION happens internally. Remember: here is the essence, that's the foundation (Generative Polarity), this is that first stage, that first building block that we called KNOWLEDGE or lack thereof, this is the second building block, which we called understanding or lack thereof. This is true understanding when Truth has been taken in and accepted, and this is the lack of understanding. Now, in that state of lack of understanding, we're confused, so there's no rulership within. Inside of us, there is anarchy, which means the absence of ruler, of a ruler, not the absence of rules, which I'm gonna get into later. Anarchy means there's no ruler, no master. So, if there's no master inwardly, we have a big problem, because that means there's no self-mastery, there's no self-control, there's no self-discipline, and ultimately there’s no self-love. And that results in an understanding that we don't truly own ourselves; it would result in the absence of self-ownership, which is what we're experiencing as a species, that other people believe that they own other people.

### Part 124
This is what I found as a picture representing CONFUSION, someone who doesn't know themself. Doesn't know themself, completely attached to a ego-identity. their whole mind is all wrapped up in “I believe I'm this businessman, I believe I'm this banker, I believe I'm this lawyer, I believe I'm this doctor, and that's my identity. And if something goes wrong with that, there goes my identity. There's who I am down the drain.”

### Part 125
This negative aspect of The Internal Expression of Natural Law is cONFUSION, or what I call internal anarchy, meaning no ruler within. CONFUSION is the state of mind in which the being is ruled by fear and ignorance. CONFUSION could be seen as internal opposition, opposition within one's own consciousness. In other words, being torn apart from within, in such a way that one's own thoughts, emotions and actions are in perpetual contradiction with each other. A thought, emotion and action are not in alignment, as we think, is not how we truly feel, and is not how we act, there’s total contradiction and separation, no unity amongst those three aspects of consciousness. that's CONFUSION.

### Part 126
The 4th expression of Natural Law is what happens externally in the macrocosm, in society. When you have a bunch of people who are in either this dynamic
(pointing to the other expressions on the slide) within their own consciousness, or a bunch of people who are in this dynamic in their own consciousness, a state results in the society at large, because the society at large is comprised of the aggregate quality of the individuals that comprise that society. So, if there is LOVE present and KNOWLEDGE
has been taken in, and it's been understood, and we understand that we are SOVEREIGN, and we're expressing self-ownership and self-mastery, what state manifests in society?

FREEDOM, there it is. FREEDOM can only manifest when those preceding conditions are in place; it cannot magically manifest by any other means. If we say we want to be free, this is the path we have to take: consciousness, acceptance of truth, and an understanding of our own SOVEREIGNTY through self-mastery. It can't happen any other way; it's not possible.

### Part 127
So, this is the picture I chose for FREEDOM. This is actually on the cover of probably one of the greatest books I think that has ever been penned by human hands, and I've read a whole lot of books in my life. And for me to say that, it's a high compliment. I think I'm a pretty good judge of books that can impart some wisdom to people. And I'm telling you, you need to read the book: “The End of All Evil” by Jeremy locke, if you haven't already read it. This is the cover image from that book. Very rare book, to find it physically online, if you find it at a decent price, snatch it up, and give it to other people or sell it to other people.
i had a physical copy of this book, I lent it out, took off, forgot who I lent it to, it happens right. But this is a rare book, and I think it was only ever pressed a couple thousand times, and it's never been repressed. So, it's a single printing or something like that and never repressed it. Now, you'll find that book for $150-$200 in some places. I finally found it at some foreign source online, for like $20-$25 and jumped all over it, and I finally have a new physical copy of it. One of the books, along with Larken Rose's book:
“The Most Dangerous Superstition,” that if I had to tell you to destroy every other book on earth, it would be down to these 2; it's that much, they're that important. This is the cover image from that book with chains being broken that were formerly holding the earth in captivity. I think it's a great image that represents what FREEDOM is about. It's not about “my FREEDOM,” it's about our FREEDOM. It's about FREEDOM for all being, and guess what? “Our,” when I say that in relationship to the earth, doesn't just mean human beings, it means all beings, including the animal kingdom.

### Part 128
So, the positive aspect of the external expression is FREEDOM, or what I call external anarchy, meaning; externally, there are no rulers. There is no condition of masters and slaves. So, that's what anarchy actually means, the absence of slavery. that's what it really means. True FREEDOM for all should be seen as the goal of spiritual development. Such a state can only manifest as a result of human society's adherence to Natural Law. Can only manifest, not just will manifest; the only way it is possible for it to manifest is if we understand and adhere to Natural Law. So that's the positive external expression; what happens in society.

### Part 129
Now, there's a negative external expression, and you can call it multiple things: you can call it totalitarianism, you could call it slavery, I term it simply cONTROL. Externally imposed CONTROL. It doesn't mean self-control, it means literally, someone outside of your own being is trying to CONTROL you and own you. so, a good way of looking at it would be slavery as well, as control leads to slavery.
cONTROL is what I call “external monarchy.” Meaning, there's a ruler from without that believes they do own you and wants to continue to own you as their subject or slave.

### Part 130
And this manifests in things like the oncoming police state, which I wouldn't even say is oncoming, I would say it's here, I'd say we're already living in it. It's not something that's going to happen in the future, it's something that's happening in the present. People talk about it as it's something they're trying to avoid from happening. what makes people think it's not already happening?

### Part 131
The negative aspect of the external expression of Natural Law is cONTROL, what I call external monarchy, one external ruler; the concentration of illusory power in the hands of institutions like government. CONTROL is the pathway to all forms of evil and destruction. It results when a society lives in direct opposition to natural Law.

### Part 132
The 5th and final expression for Natural Law, how it operates in our lives, is what I call the Manifestation or the result that we create. So, again (referring to the slide), here’s the foundation for that little 4 part building: here is the first block, kNOWLEDGE or lack thereof, here’s the second block, understanding
(SOVEREIGNTY) or lack thereof, here’s the third block, wisdom (FREEDOM) or lack thereof. Which is why we are in a society that’s completely based in CONTROL: we're drowning in KNOWLEDGE and haven't a lick of wisdom (FREEDOM), or very, very little, I should say. Certainly not enough to go around. That's the action stage or the wisdom stage; what happens externally. This is that top block, remember the top white block that sat on the top (from slide 65)? Where we had the blue block at the bottom, then the red, then the green, and then the white block, this was the manifestation, the result that we create. Remember the little question I put up on the top of that white block? Who can tell me what it was? The manifestation? No, the manifestation was either order or chaos. What do we ultimately create?

So, the positive manifestation is ORDER, or what we would call all the things we say we want. Manifested goodness, everything being okay, not creating self- inflicting chaos or suffering. This would be “we get what we say we want to get.” And there's requirements for that, and here they are, there’s the requirements (previous positive expressions): you gotta be in this vibratory energy of consciousness, you have to accept the Truth and develop KNOWLEDGE, you have to have an understanding that you're a SOVEREIGN being, and you have to work towards the manifestation of true fREEDOM. Then, you'll have all the things you say you want: manifested goodness and order in your life. And that's the only path to it. I'm telling you that's the only path to it, blanket statement. The human mind has a hard time with blanket statements; it has a hard time with “always,” “every,” “without exception.” The ego doesn't want to hear that, again, humanity's greatest fear may be that the Truth is absolute. I would say an even greater fear it has is that truth is singular, that there’s no such thing as my truth, your truth, his truth, her truth, their truth. There’s just the truth and whether we align our perceptions to it or not. That's humanity's biggest fear.

### Part 133
So, this is what I viewed ORDER as being like: we have beings actually full of the light, and they're working toward a world that is based in FREEDOM, cooperation, kNOWLEDGE, SOVEREIGNTY, no CONTROL. It's what I call in some of my former presentations: cooperative spiritual anarchy, which is that natural condition of humanity. the natural: meaning spiritual, natural condition of the human species, that has been blocked from manifesting through mind control, indoctrination, fear-based, trauma-based methods.

### Part 134
That is what I call ORDER: the positive manifestation, manifested goodness. it represents everything we say we want, and it only results when there is balance or justice. Justice comes about through adherence to Natural Law. Justice can only be present when Truth has been accepted in our lives, and our behavior has been brought into harmony with Natural Law. Cannot manifest any other way. That's the positive manifestation.

### Part 135
The negative manifestation is the opposite of order: CHAOS. CHAOS is manifested evil.

### Part 136
Let me just put this as complete disregard for other people, a breakdown,
“me me me“ “Me first, knock anybody else down, get what I want, don't worry about anybody else getting hurt, don't worry about anybody else's freedom, don't worry about whether anybody else's Rights are being tread all over, it doesn't matter, let me get mine, self-preservation is the highest law, survival is all that matters, even if I have to step on somebody else to get it, to make that happen.” (Comment from the audience) yeah, it's an animal, that's exactly right, sir, that's exactly correct. That's not a human being, that's an animal. That's how animals in the animal kingdom behave. And again, Natural Law doesn't work the same way for animals as it does for human beings because they do not have the same capacity for consciousness that a human being has. So, let's not start saying “that’s the natural order.” No it is not, it is the exact antithesis of the Natural order. The Natural Order is just that; ORDER. It's in the word; it's in the phrase, Natural oRDER. What people are describing as the natural order through this utter nonsense concept called Social Darwinism is as I've called it before; psychopathic chaos. And break down that word, psychopathology means an illness of the mind. Psychopathy is mental illness. Psyche in Greek means the mind, and pathology is an illness, sickness. psychopaths are mentally ill, and they don't create anything resembling order. All they can create is CHAOS, which is why they want us to mimic their mindset because they're just bent on hell and destruction to manifest. And they have to have our complicity and cooperation to make that dynamic happen. Our energy has to be given over to them by our mindset being made to be like theirs. Otherwise, their worldview can't come into manifestation, which is one of CHAOS and dis-ORDER.

### Part 137
The negative manifestation: CHAOS or manifested evil, is the exact opposite of what we say we want. CHAOS results when there is imbalance and injustice which results whenever there is IGNORANCE of Truth and behavior which is in direct opposition to Natural Law.

### Part 135
So, that's our chart, and one last thing I wanted to say about it is that the manifestations or the expressions of Natural Law are what I would call; they're unilateral. they don't cross into each other. There's no such thing as “well, I've accepted the Truth and I've developed KNOWLEDGE, so now I'm in a state of CONFUSION.” It doesn't work like that. You can't go from IGNORANCE to SOVEREIGNTY, to the understanding that you're sovereign. You cannot cross this area, the area of these charts. once you're here (FEAR), you can only go here (CHAOS). In order to get to here
(ORDER), you gotta come from here (LOVE). In order to get to here (ORDER), you gotta come from here (FREEDOM), here (SOVEREIGNTY), here (KNOWLEDGE) and here (LOVE). You don't get there from any of these; you don't get here (ORDER) from anywhere in this column (negative). You don't get here (FREEDOM) from anything in this column (FEAR). Please keep this in mind. These expressions are unilateral.
(Question from the audience) no, they cannot be skipped either, good question. They must proceed in order and in the same column of expression.

### Part 138
So, you can only get to ORDER through FREEDOM, which comes about through the understanding that we are SOVEREIGN, which comes about through taking in KNOWLEDGE of Truth, and which comes about through staying in a vibratory energy of LOVE or higher consciousness; the openness to Truth, that's it. Same thing here: we can only create CHAOS when our society is bent on CONTROL because we are cONFUSED beings that don't understand our SOVEREIGNTY and think other people can legitimately own us or rule us, and that comes from a place of IGNORANCE or refusal of the Truth, which is based in FEAR. Can only manifest that way. Blanket statement too. And I will not retract on that blanket statement because this has nothing to do with what I think or feel in my beliefs. This is how Laws is operating in creation. Not a belief system, not a religion, has absolutely nothing to do (with)... I didn't develop this. i came to an understanding of it by seeking Truth. I'm telling you this is not my information, never has been my information, never will be my information, there's no copyright on it, I don't claim it, it's eternal Truths that have existed forever and will exist forever whether human beings are here or not. Take it and share it freely and widely to anybody that is capable of comprehending it, because it's the only way we're going to get out of this mess. Those are the expressions of Natural Law.
