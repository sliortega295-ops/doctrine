title: Conscience
description: Most people don't seem to think of conscience as knowledge, while that is exactly what it truly is. It isn't behavior, it isn't action; it's knowledge.

## Etymology
The word **_Conscience_** is derived from the Latin prefix **_Con-_** which means "Together, or with" and the Latin verb **_Scire_** which means "to Know, or to Understand". Those two words combined mean "to Know together". Therefore:

::tip
Conscience is common sense, quite literally. All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong behavior according to Natural Law.
::

## Exercise of Conscience (Action)
The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong according to Natural Law has been acquired and integrated into the being. We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act either in accordance with it, or in disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, that is called the exercise of conscience.

## Transcript

### Part 169
that's the key folks. That's the key to the prison door, and what we're really talking about here is common sense. That's what conscience is. People don't think of conscience as common sense.

### Part 170
You know, they don't think of conscience as knowledge. Conscience is knowledge. It's not action. It's not behavior. It's knowledge. Again, knowledge is the way out of this. Okay? And this is the knowledge that has to be developed. Conscience comes from the Latin prefix, con meaning together and the Latin verb sciere meaning to know or to understand. You put them together: to know together, to understand together. conscience is common sense, common sense knowing. Common sense knowledge literally, from the etymological breakdown of the word: con together, science, to know. that's why the problem is people don't have common sense.

### Part 171
That's why I'm sitting there almost laughing hysterically that I need to try to teach common sense to people. The ridiculousness of it, what we all need to be doing is doing that work. You know, I know you guys get a lot of this. We need to start reaching out to other people. I'm going to talk about that in a moment. Conscience, the definition of it is the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between Right and Wrong according to Natural Law. Objective. Definitive. It's not up for debate. It exists inherently and objectively; it can be understood, known, discovered.

### Part 172
This is different from action. Conscience is the knowledge. Then we act upon it. So, it's different from understanding something and acting upon it. Right? To have Conscience is to have common sense. It's to know the difference between Right and wrong and understand that difference deeply. Then we're going to convert that into action. We exercise conscience. The exercise of conscience is actually action. The exercise of conscience is the freewill choice of Right action over Wrong action. Once the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between Right and Wrong, according to natural Law, has been acquired and integrated into the being. We acquire that knowledge first, understand it, then we act in either accordance with it or disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, it's called the exercise of conscience. That's action.
