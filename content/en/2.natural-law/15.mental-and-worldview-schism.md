the schism of the individual. This is critical because this is not only a schism within the individual consciousness, it's a schism of world view; of the way we view ourselves in the world and the way we view our relationships with others in the world.

#### Slide 58
So, I call this the mental schism. And it highlights basically what will happen, what kinds of thinking will manifest when certain types of brain imbalance are present. So, when we're in this schism, and again most of humanity is, if we're overly intellectualizing everything and we're too much in the masculine hemisphere of the brain, we're not using the right or intuitive capacities of the brain, the right-brain hemisphere. what this can lead to in the world is, again, rigid skepticism. Now what did we say about that? It's not conducive to learning. People aren't really going to learn when they're rigidly skeptical; this is a hallmark of scientism. Scientismists, I don't know what other thing to call it, worshippers of the altar of scientism. They have this rigid skepticism because they're purely intellectual, they're not really intelligent. The creative aspect is missing from their personality makeup. Atheism is a hallmark of overly dominant left- brain thinking because that shuns all aspects of spiritual reality; there is no spirit; the universe is a grand cosmic accident. From there, you get things like solipsism; people will say, “well, isn't solipsism purely right-brain?” And I say no, it is left-brain imbalance as well. Solipsism can be generated from both forms of imbalance; of believing nothing can actually be known. “There is no truth;” truth is a dirty word to many left-brain (chronically dominant) individuals you'll note. So, solipsism plays into left-brain imbalance as well. All of these states here inevitably lead to these things down here (left part of the slide). Moral relativism comes next. The idea that there’s no such thing as the difference between Right and Wrong. That we just get to make those things up, “they don't inherently exist in nature, we can just decide on what's Right and what's wrong for ourselves and make it up randomly.” So, a very, very dangerous ideology that we're going to talk about a lot.

Social Darwinism inevitably comes after that. This is the idea that a certain class of society can get to direct how the lives of everybody else will go because they're the “intelligencia” so called, or the intellectual people is really what it is, the over- intellectualizing, and will direct society because “we're the fittest.” Darwinism postulates the survival of the fittest. Well social Darwinism postulates the survival of the most socially ruthless, and many people believe that's the natural order. They believe that's the natural order, and nothing could be farther from the truth. What that is, is it’s the psychopathic chaos. It has nothing to do nature, and it has nothing to do with order. It's the exact opposite. So, this state- and these are hallmarks of dark occultism as well, I think I should know a thing or two about it as I was a priest in it for almost 10 years, I might know a couple of things about satanism. So, moral relativism is one of the big tenets of satanism. It's actually one of the pillars of satanism. Social Darwinism is highly praised and valued in satanism, and eugenics, because people don't understand what eugenics is. Eugenics is basically people who have gone so deep into this form of left-brain imbalance that they believe they're god, and they can get to decide who lives and who dies. That's really what it is; “we will control who breeds and who does not get to breed, who gets to live and who does not get to live.” That's essentially eugenics in a nutshell, and again these are all forms of Authoritarianism. It's the idea that “man is the author, man is the creator, man is the god, man will make the law, man will decide life and death at any given moment, who will decide what is Right or Wrong, etc.” That's essentially what all these forms of thought are, extreme left-brained imbalance. And I was there, I was in this state in my life, I was in it- for years, for years.

let's look at the other form of imbalance. If the right side of the brain is chronically dominant, this leads to a similar kind of imbalance but in the exact opposite form. The brain is still completely imbalanced, therefore the person is not in a high state of consciousness. They're completely unconscious to what's really going on within them and around them, but the manifestation is generally the opposite of the left-brain forms of imbalance. So, if you're in a real right-brain imbalanced state of consciousness, this will lead to naiveté. Believing anything you're told, accepting things from “channels and official sources” without actually checking into them for yourself. Blind belief, you'll believe the next religion that comes along, “we just have to tell them what they want to hear” and “well I'll believe that.” So, new agers are basically in this category: naiveté and blind belief. People who trust government are of course are in that category, because again it's about creating the masters and the slaves. That's what brain imbalance is for, and that's why the controllers want to propagate this imbalance and keep it in place. again, religious extremism, that's hallmarks of right-brain belief, right-brain imbalance. solipsism: “no such thing as truth,” all from right-brain imbalance as well. Feelings of unworthiness, self-loathing, accepting orders from other people, being an order follower;
we're gonna have a whole section on order followers later and how this is the exact opposite of anything virtuous. For people that think order following is some kind of a virtue, I don't know what to tell you, but it's the thing that leads to all evil in the world, is accepting someone’s orders and not actually gauging for yourself whether the activity, the behavior is moral or not. And it creates a willing slave, this form of imbalance (right- brain) is ultimately generating a willing slave, whereas this form of imbalance (left-brain) is ultimately generating a psychopathic master. And they're all forms of mind control, it's just another aspect of how mind control works. The propagators of mind control are just doing this to keep that imbalance present in one form or another. They don't even care which it is, as long as they have some that are imbalanced in one direction, and some that are balanced toward the other direction. That's how the dynamic plays off against itself, and you have a world that is continued to be kept under lockdown.

#### Slide 59
So, let's look at the worldview schism that goes hand in hand with the brain schism or the mental schism. Again, this worldview is exactly what it says; how you
view the world, how do you view yourself in it, how do you view others in it. Well, when there's chronic left-brain dominance, the worldview that emerges is one of randomness. And again this is a hallmark of scientism; “the world is this grand cosmic accident, the whole universe is a grand accident, there is no purpose, there’s no creator; everything just magically manifested on its own for no reason from a single singularity, a single point in space-time for no reason.” “You give me that one, and I'll tell you everything else that happened after that, but you gotta give me that one... and I have some bridges to sell you.” So, there's no underlying intelligence in nature, nature is dead. that's what this worldview is about; nature is dead, it's a dead thing, it's a mechanized machine that is there for no reason. There is no such thing as the spirit at all, no such thing as spiritual dimension, no such thing as Natural Law certainly, because for one to accept Natural Law, well, where does it come from? I ask people whether they accept that Natural Law exists or that there’s actual objective truth and morality, and two-thirds of people don't accept it, they don't believe it exists. They don't think there is an objective reality and objective truth and objective morality. They think it's all relative and that we get to make it up. I've actually done a small psychological profiling or study just asking people this question at random and collecting results and analyzing them. we're at about two-thirds of people who are moral relativists, and believe that truth is relative also, that it's not objective. Now, you ask the same people; “do they believe in karma?” 88 almost 90% of people believe karma is real and it exists. So, I'm like “I can't believe this, you're gonna tell me that there's no such thing as the real difference between right and Wrong?” They're constructs in the human mind, is what they think, and simultaneously holding in their mind the idea that karma exists. Well, I ask them the question, “what put karma in place then? You believe it exists; what force created it? what made it? What put it in place?” And they have no answer for that. They intuitively believe karma exists but can't answer where did it come from, because that would involve a creator, and somebody in left-brain imbalance can't acknowledge that.
to a left-brain imbalanced person, there’s s no such thing as Spiritual or Natural Law; it doesn't exist. As a matter of fact, all of existence has no purpose other than to continue its existence, see; survival is the highest aspiration to a left-brain imbalanced individual.

right and Wrong have no bearing, there's no point in even discussing it, because “Right is what's Right for me” if I'm super left-brain imbalanced, “Wrong is whatever affects me negatively.” It doesn't matter what's actually moral, it's all subjective to a left-brain imbalanced individual. And to them, nothing has any purpose, since it's all a grand cosmic accident, how could there be a purpose for existence? Without a creator, who's going to create a purpose for it? So, it has no purpose other than to continue to keep surviving. And again, that right there is proof they’re in the R-complex, they’re the base brain; “survival is the highest goal, survival is the only aspiration.” Now, in satanism, it's about as left-brain imbalanced as it gets folks. You know what their number one law is? survival. Survival is the highest law. We hear about this in Darwinism too, the ultimate purpose of the being is to continue to survive. I would highly debate that, I would highly disagree with that; there are laws higher than survival. But in satanism, they simply refer to it as self-preservation, and that means preservation of systems of belief as well. systems that are serving the self, the egoic self, they must continue to survive. Self- preservation as the highest law, that's the number one tenet of satanism, and it doesn't matter who you need to step on to do it, who you need to step on to get one up on somebody else. This is extreme left-brain imbalance worldview. All of these characteristics in the randomness worldview are hallmarks of scientism, atheism, totalitarianism, and dark occultism, you could add to that list. Whether you refer to it as satanism, dark luciferianism, it doesn't make a difference; it's the hallmarks of the dark occult.

on the other side, on the right-brain imbalanced side of the worldview, there is another worldview called determinism. Determinism is based in right-brain imbalance and is defined by, in general, helplessness, religiosity, and the dismissal of free will. This worldview will eventually lead to a society of blind order followers and willing slaves, who accept their conditions as their lot in life. So, hallmarks of deterministic worldview: god controls every event in creation, nothing happens at random, there is no free will, so you can never throw anything a curveball through free will, every event is preordained, and religionists believe in this. See, I like to say, my presentation is gonna piss everybody off, and that's what it should do because if you're in one of these forms of belief systems, it represents one form of imbalance or another. So, people who believe in government and science are in that left-brain imbalance, they're gonna get pissed off that i'm talking about that form of imbalance. And then the people who are in religion and the new age movement, they're in that right form of imbalance, so they're gonna get pissed off at that. Good. Let them be pissed off. The truth will piss you off and then it will set you free if you accept it. So, “all occurrences are preordained, free will is an illusion,” you know who just said this in his latest book? Stephen Hawking, who you would think is the most left-brain person that you could ever think of, worships at the altar of scientism, thinks that the universe is a grand accident, and a mechanized machine. he, it's like this comes full circle, it feeds off of each other like a feedback loop, these two forms of imbalance. He went so far through left-brain imbalance, he's so in the left- brain, that he actually developed the hallmark of right-brained imbalance which is, “that there’s no such thing as free will.” “No such thing, since it’s all a machine and there’s no consciousness, there can actually be no choice; we're actually robots controlled by matter.” Hawking believes this; he actually wrote this in his book. He said, “free will is as dead as God.” Millions of people buy this moron’s books, and I'll call him a moron right to his face. There’s not a drop of intelligence in that man, and people think he is one of the most intelligent people in the world. You might be one of the most overly intellectual people in the world, but you have no wisdom at all, zero, if that's how you think. And again, put him in front of me and I'll tell it to him to his face because these people actually believe that he's smart! That person isn't smart, he's dumb! He's intellectual, but that doesn't make you intelligent. He has no part of the big picture, none. just because you can theorize something and visualize it and calculate it mathematically does not make you an intelligent person. That means you're great at using the intellect, you're great at mathematics, you’re great at linear and logical thinking- that does not make you wise.

to continue with the right-brained imbalanced worldview, “since God controls everything in creation, nothing is possible to change; human beings are powerless to create change. Everything is being made to be this way by God.” This is what religionists and right-brain imbalanced people think. “So, therefore, why take any action? Action is ultimately meaningless.” A big hallmark of the new age community because it's a religion. The course in miracles: “we just need to accept everything the way that it is right folks? It doesn't make a difference if evil is running amuck in our midst, no, accept it all, don't try to change a damn thing. Take no action, just observe.” and just see how far deeper that gets you into bondage because that's the best way to get real deeper into chains.
these are all hallmarks of religious extremism and what I call simply; “slave-think” because that's what it is. Let's not euphemize anything, let's call them what it really is. this is master think, that's slave-think. And if you want a world that continues to propagate slavery, you'll stay in one of those forms of brain imbalance. And this right- brained imbalance in addition to religious extremism and slave think is the hallmark of the new age movement and their followers, their religious followers. Now there’s a balance that is struck between these, and that's what everything really is ultimately about; creating a balance, because there are components to these two worldviews that if they come together, it shows us what the truth is. And here it is right in the middle here
(referring to the slide); there is a deterministic component to reality, and there is a random component to reality, existing in cooperation with each other, in conjunction with each other. The deterministic component is what I'm talking about here today in referring to, under the banner of Natural Law. That is determined, it is Law, it is set, you're never changing it, it works that way flawlessly 100% of the time. That's determined, Natural law is determined, it's the deterministic component to reality. Then there is a randomness component to reality that works continuously in conjunction with Natural law, and this is a little thing called free will: our ability to choose our behaviors; to do certain things and to not choose to do certain things. And we have it. Every individual has it no matter what position, no matter what situation they're in, I don't care what institution you're in, I don't care who you've listened to up to this point, I don't care what background you come from, I don't care what economic class you come from. Every single solitary being that is capable of thinking at all is gifted with free will. You have free will to choose your behaviors, and so does every other human being. Everyone. It's
a gift of creation itself. We can choose what we will do and not do; nobody can actually make anybody do something like a robot, oh believe me there’s people who are trying.

like Art talked about, Jose Delgado was searching for means to electronically directly control, through chip implants and stimulus through chip implants in the brain, human behavior. Like a robot, to put technology into the brain to control the behavior of the individual. And that went on right here; this is where that took place folks, right on yale’s campus. Read some of his stuff. You want to be disturbed? You think what I'm telling you is somewhat disturbing, read some of Delgato's material. He was telling people “we're gonna show you that free will doesn't exist, we're gonna show you there's no such thing as Rights. That we make up what Rights are. The ruling class makes up what a Right and a Wrong is, and we tell you, you have no choice.” And he was telling you, “we’re going to show you; you have no Rights, that you're our slaves.” Yeah, read some of his material. An excellent book art recommended too, Jim Keith: Mass Control - the Engineering Of Human Consciousness. If you haven't read that book, get it and read it. And that's just an introduction. And many people think he was murdered over it.

so, truth lies in the middle of these worldviews, there's a deterministic component called natural Law, and there's a random component called free will, our ability to choose our behavior freely.
