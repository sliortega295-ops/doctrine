## Balanced Consciousness
In order to speak the lost word, a person must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium (balance) between the left and right brain hemispheres.

In such a state of balanced consciousness, the individual has come to know the self (microcosm), as well as the working operations of Natural Law (macrocosm), and in doing so has come to understand the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. Or as they are referred to in Freemasonry, "**Light** (Knowledge)" and "**Darkness** (Ignorance)".

## The Word of All Power
In the balanced state of consciousness generated through the knowledge of Natural Law, a person is finally able to speak the lost word, which is - "**No**".

In Freemasonry it is considered to be the word of all power. When we say no to those who claim to be our owners, those who claim that they will decide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our
rights (all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the **knowledge, care, and courage** that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be "lost".

## Know your Rights
The reason you have to know what the difference between right and wrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have, is because those who don't know, won't say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner).

THE LOST WORD
the Lost Word: this is the end of the Natural Law segment and I’m just going to talk about solutions toward the end a little bit.


#### Slide 237
The Lost Word: it’s a concept in esoteric freemasonry which represents a state of consciousness that has been largely “lost” to the majority of human beings. In order to speak the “lost word,” a human being must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium or balance between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. In such a state of balanced consciousness, the being has come to know one’s self, as well as the working operations of the macrocosm meaning Natural Law. In doing so, that person has also come to understand the objective difference between Right and wrong, or, as these concepts are referred to in the tradition of freemasonry, they have come to understand the difference between light, which is Right, and darkness, which is wrong, or light which is knowledge of Right and Wrong, and darkness which is ignorance of Right and Wrong respectively.


#### Slide 238
What is the lost word though? That’s the lost word ladies and gentlemen (“NO”). You know the knowledge of the highest levels of freemasonry now. Most actual freemasons in the lodge system don’t know the lost word. The lost word is “no.” I would suggest to you, it is a dual word. The lost word is dual, meaning it’s two things, it’s not just one. It is the word no (n-o) and it is the word know (k-n-o-w). Those are the lost words. In the enlightened state of consciousness generated through the knowledge of natural Law, a human being is finally able to speak the so-called “lost word,” which is “No.” No is the word of all power. Only when we say no to those who would claim to be our owners, those who would claim that it is they who will decide which Rights we have or do not have, do we stop externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our Rights, all of our property that has been taken without right. Sadly, very, very few people in our world have the knowledge, care and courage that is required to do this. This is why this all-powerful word is considered “lost.”


#### Slide 239
And there’s the other variant of the lost word: know. Know your Rights. the reason you have to know what the difference between Right and Wrong is and therefore know what Rights you have and what Rights you do not have, is because those who do not know those things will never say the lost word to someone who claims to be their owner. They will not say no (n-o).
