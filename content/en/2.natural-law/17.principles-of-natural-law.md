title: Principles of Natural Law
description: Natural Law is expressed through seven basic underlying principles, and the 8th Lost Principle which binds the other seven together. These principles constitute as the Master Key through which universal wisdom is unveiled.

## The Principles

### Etymology
The word **_Principle_** is derived from the Latin noun **_Principia_** which means "First, Foremost, Leading, or Most necessary". In other words, that which is most important.

## Mentalism

</div>

**All is mind; the universe is mental.** Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create, by being responsible for everything you think.

---

## Correspondence

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-correspondence" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**As above so below.** That which is above is like to that which is below, that which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of one another. The universe is self-similar across all scales.

---

## Vibration

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-vibration" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Nothing rests, everything moves.** At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no 'solidity' as such; the universe is 'holographic.' Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration.

---

## Polarity

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-polarity" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Everything is dual, everything has poles.** Everything has its opposite. Opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled.

---

## Rhythm

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-rhythm" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Everything flows; out and in, in and out.** Everything has its tides. All things rise and fall. The pendulum swing manifests in everything. The measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing to the left. Rhythm compensates.

---

## Causality

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-causality" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Cause and effect.** Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law. Chance is but a name for law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why Natural Law is also sometimes referred to as Consequentialism.

---

## Gender

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-gender" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Gender is in everything.** Everything has its masculine and feminine properties; gender manifests on all planes. While every person has a biological sex, psychologically both qualities exist simultaneously within everyone, and everything.

---

## Care

<div class="my-8 w-full h-48 md:h-72 flex justify-center items-center aspect-video bg-neutral-500/10 rounded-2xl">

  :icon{name="i-local-picon-care" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

**Care, not compassion.** Whatever you give attention to, and help to grow. This does not mean you shouldn't care for any negative things happening in the world because you think that will feed into it and give power to it; if that happens only ignorance is being fed into it. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it will occur. The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality.

::note
What we care about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions.
::

What we as conscious beings need to develop are heart, mind, and guts, in that order. We must care enough to know, and then act accordingly to that understood knowledge. All three must be in place to gain unity consciousness; unifying thoughts, emotions, and actions. Therefore, care can be seen as the ultimate generator of the quality of our experience of life.

Hence the 8<sup>th</sup> principle is also known as the generative principle. True care is created in our hearts, the 'pump' that causes our blood to flow through our body, in many ancient traditions they spoke of the 'life force' being in the blood. As important as the brain is, the heart is ultimately generating the experience. Because what we care about becomes what we think about, and therefore, how we behave.

That which we care enough about to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created in our world. The reason the world is in the state it's in, is because most people do not care enough (even if they say they want things to be different) to change it through their behavior.

  :icon{name="i-local-sol" class="size-32 md:size-48 text-primary"}

</div>

## The Lost Principle

The principle of Care is also referred to as the Lost Principle. This principle encapsulates all seven other principles; if you look at the seven circles that form the seed of life, the 8<sup>th</sup> added circle forms the outer shell. Without this shell present and intact, the creative (generative) essence of the seed will be lost.

#### Slide 66
PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL LAW
so, let's look at some principles of Natural Law. Now in my extended seminar which goes over a six-week class of lessons, I get into these principles deeply in an extended form. We're not going to do that today because time doesn't allow, I'm going to briefly touch on each one.

#### Slide 67
The word principles, let's define it. Principle comes from that Latin noun principia. Principia means: first, foremost, leading, chief, or most necessary. It is that which matters most. It is the first things that must be understood before anything else can be understood. Principles have to come first. And this is the problem; our society does not put principles first. It puts trivialities first, and we're no longer a society that cares about principles or first things. So first things first, first things or first principles have to come first.

#### Slide 68
So, let's look at what the principles that underlie Natural Law. These are the things that are most important. That's what principles should mean to people. If we ask
people to define what a principle is, the first thing they should say: “that's the most important thing, the most important thing in my life.”
in the Natural Law seminar, we did a homework assignment; we asked people what the most important thing was to them. Very few responded with principles. Most people responded with say that “people” or “the family” was the number one response. The familial connection was more important to them than principles. Now when people hear me say that that's backwards, they’ll say, “ho w cold are you? That’s so cold.” What I'm telling you is that the familial connection, no matter what it is: between a mother and a son, mother and a daughter, father and a son, father and a daughter, husband and wife, it doesn't matter, as much as principles. I'm not telling you that they don't matter at all. I'm telling you, you have to put principles first, otherwise those relationships are just meaningless. They don't really have any real value unless they’re based upon principles first, which is why so many relationships are dysfunctional. Principles have to come first before you can even build a solid relationship with another human being.

#### Slide 69
Let’s look at some of the principles of how Natural Laws work first before we can actually find out what these expressions of these laws are in our lives, which will be the next section.
these are what I call the general principles of Natural Law. Natural law is expressed through 7 basic underlying principles, plus what I have referred to as an 8th or hidden principle which you hear very few other researchers, even people who are studying this from the occult perspective, who are studying this from the Consequentialism perspective, you rarely hear them incorporate the 8th and all-encompassing principle, which I'll get to last here. This 8th principle, which I call the Lost Principle, binds all the other 7 principles together. These principles together constitute a master key, through which universal wisdom, including the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining what we desire, is then unveiled or de-occulted.
when people ask me, “well what do you consider yourself in your performance of presenting what you present?” I tell them, “I consider myself a de-occultist.” I'm no longer an occultist; I'm a de-occultist. I'm attempting to take this information out of hiding; it’s been hidden. The hiding of it is destroying the fabric of our society and putting us into bondage. It needs to come out and be non-hidden, it needs to be unveiled and shared widely and freely with anybody who’s capable of accepting it and comprehending it now because we're not in a position where we can wait longer. We're at the precipice. There is a moral obligation to bring this information to the public now. so, I consider myself a de-occultist; one who takes things out of hiding and presents them openly.

#### Slide 70
These are the 7 General Principles of Natural Law. Many people who have studied some variants of occultism may recognize these as what are known as the hermetic Principles. Hermetic essentially comes from Hermes, Hermes Trismegistus, the Thrice Great One as he was referred to in the ancient Greek mystery traditions. He was considered a messenger of the gods; he brought the wisdom of the gods down to
humanity. In the ancient Egyptian and Khemetion traditions, he was the scribe of the gods known as Thoth. He has other incarnations as well, but the Hermetic tradition is named such because it’s Hermetically Sealed like Natural Law is. Natural law is hermetically Sealed. It is binding principles that are immutable. They are laws that are in operation that cannot be changed, hence they Hermetically Sealed. So, these 7 General principles, they are: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, which is a huge one which we will be getting into, and Gender. I'm going to briefly describe what each of these are and what they are about.

#### Slide 71
The principle of Mentalism states that: The All, everything in creation, is actually a manifestation of mind. The All is mind. What this means is everything that happens has to be the result of a mental state which preceded it, everything. For anything to exist, thoughts had to form first, and then they formed the physical reality after. The universe itself is a mental construct of the creator.
thoughts lead to the manifestation of things and events. Thoughts create conditions. thoughts create things and conditions; they cannot just magically manifest themself. thought comes first. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on earth, ultimately. Therefore, we should be responsible for everything that we create by being responsible for that which we think. Because the thought processes are what are driving the behaviors. People behave the way they do because they have certain belief systems embedded in the mind and running like a program. Their thoughts and their emotions are driving their actions. So, the behavior’s not magically, suddenly just gonna change; the thoughts and the emotions have to change because they're the driving force behind the behavior. That's when reality will change. See, people don't want to hear that, once again. They don't want to hear; if you want to change reality, you yourself have to change the way you think because the way you think is not conducive to the requirements for getting what you say you want. They're doing the exact opposite of that in many cases. So, that's the Principle of Mentalism

#### Slide 72
The Principle of Correspondence states that: that which is above is similar or like to that which is below. What this means is, that which is below is like to that which is above; it's a mirror. The above is like the below, the below is like the above. The above, in this case, is the macrocosm: the laws of the very large things, the laws that govern the creation which we consider is seemingly outside of ourselves. We know at the deepest level that it's not, that we're one with it, but we perceive this as out here, the laws that govern the large aspects of things. So, the macrocosm, or the very large, the totality of everything, and the microcosm, which is the very small or the individuated units that comprise the whole in their aggregate. They are reflections of each other. they cannot be separated from each other, as one goes, the other goes.
the universe is actually a holographic system. A hologram is an image; you pass a laser through it and it then projects a 3D image, it's like a flat image, and it projects a 3- dimensional image. But the aspect, why they call it a “holo,” like holistic, hologram - holistic image, is if you break a hologram into multiple components by cutting it, so if I take a hologram and cut it in 4 pieces, you don't have a quarter of the image on one part
of the hologram and a quarter on another and a quarter on the 3rd and a quarter on the
4th, you have 4 whole images that only lose their resolution by a quarter. So, everything is contained within the smaller parts, that's like the reality that we're living in; our universe is a holographic one.
so the universe is inside the individual, and the entire universe is like an individual. they're reflections of each other. To know the workings of the individual will help lead us to an understanding of the macrocosmic laws. Similarly, to learn the macrocosmic laws will help us to learn the way that consciousness within the individual functions, these two things cannot be separated from each other.
and once again, as I said near the beginning, that's what occulted knowledge is. The knowledge of the occult is how the microcosmic world works, which is the individuated consciousness, and how the macrocosmic world works, which is Natural Law. So, the other part of the Principle of Correspondence is that our reality is also fractal in nature. now, if you've studied fractals, these are self-similar mathematical generated patterns. we see this through things like the Fibonacci sequence in mathematics, and this is repeated endlessly throughout nature. You look at the structure of the atom and it’s similar to the structure of the solar system, which is similar to the structure of the galaxy. they work the same way; they look the same, you pull back enough, you'll keep seeing the same pattern repeat.
anybody ever see the movie that was done in I think in the 1970's or 80's, it's a short 10- minute clip, it's called “Powers Of Ten” has anybody ever seen this? A couple people. watch this movie “Powers Of Ten,” and you will understand what I'm talking about when I say that the universe is fractal in nature. Brilliant movie, it will blow your mind, real short, 10 minutes long, something like that, 9 or 10 minutes long. They basically
zoom up into the cosmos to show you how everything is self-similar, then they zoom down into the cells of a human being and in the atoms that comprise the hand and cells of the hand and show you how everything is similar there. All the way down to the atomic level and the subatomic level.
so, the universe is both holographic, meaning the whole is contained in the parts and vice
versa. And it is fractal or self-similar across all scales of its existence. That's the principle of Correspondence.

#### Slide 73
The Principle of Vibration simply states that there is no such thing as rest, as in dead or non-motion. Death, in that sense, is an illusion because true death would be the cessation of all motion and energy; there is no such thing, it doesn't exist. You cannot go anywhere in creation where something is at complete rest.
and I joke around about this, Barb (Mark's at the time partner) tells me funny stories when she comes home from work, and she's trying to enlighten some of the other RN's that she works with. And she was trying to explain to one of the other nurses; “you know, that desk has atoms in it, and they're not at rest, they're in like crazy chaotic motion especially in the electron clouds of the atom, and if you look at it at a deep
enough level, you would see it's like chaos going on, and it's all kinds of motion happening, seemingly at random.” And the other nurse goes “Barb, you're so crazy.” what I say to that is; how could you have made it to nursing school and not ever have even considered the concept of the atom. It's amazing. She actually thinks- perceives stillness is actual stillness and didn’t comprehend that if you zoom into that with a powerful enough microscope, you're going to see all kinds of motion, and nothing's at rest. And she thought Barb was the weird one for trying to explain that to her.
so, there is no such thing as true rest, it doesn't exist. If something’s in existence, it's in motion. Everything moves, everything vibrates and at the most fundamental level, the universe and every single thing which comprises it, is ultimately pure vibratory energy that is manifesting itself in different ways, different frequencies, different vibratory forms. The universe has no true solidity as such, as we imagine solidity at the macrocosmic level. Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration. If we truly understand this, and many sciences are finally really understanding this and trying to propagate this knowledge out into the public. We will come to the understanding that this is a spiritual construct for experience to be gained, to have an experience, and learn and grow in consciousness. That's what the purpose of what this whole thing is for.
so, nothing is truly solid. Like we say, we are spirit having a human experience, the whole universe is spiritual, having an experience in solidity. That's how you have to look at the Principle of Vibration.

#### Slide 74
The Principle of Polarity states that everything has a dual nature to it; there are polarities in everything that exists. Everything has poles, everything has its pair of opposites. However, opposites: they are identical in nature, but they're different in degree.
so, let me give you an example of what that means; are hot and cold really opposites? Or can we simply look at them as the presence of heat energy and the absence of heat energy? Meaning that they are the same thing, energy, and whether it is concentrated in a specific area which would make it hot, or whether it is absent from a specific area, which would make it cold. That's what hot and cold are at the fundamental level. At our level of perception, they're opposites, but at the fundamental level, they're the same thing; energy or lack thereof. Just like those 3 stages of the Trivium; are knowledge and ignorance the same thing? Yeah, actually, they are! Because Truth is always present, and it's a matter of whether it's taken in and processed or whether it's refused to be taken in, and it's not processed. So, it's just like that, they're identical in their natures, but they're different in their degree. Extremes can meet and blend and play with each other like as depicted in the yin-yang symbol: masculine and feminine, they need to be blended. And at some level of reality, everything that is seemingly contradictory may be reconciled. Now again, I stress the term at some level. At the unified field level, everything is consciousness, pure consciousness. However, at this level, there are differences in consciousness, at this level, there are things taking place that we need to understand, at this level, there are things that we need to set right and rectify because it does matter. It does matter. So, again, be careful of some of the new age-isms that get
put out there. Yes, can all paradoxes be reconciled? At some level. In this realm, we need to have our feet on the ground, in the physical domain.
this is the concept in the Hermetic tradition where a lot of misunderstanding derived from, out of ancient Egypt, what is known as Khem, the land called Khem was what the actual Khemetians referred to it as. The word Egypt is a bastardization of the capital, the greek pronunciation of the capital city of Khem, which was Memphis at one point, and that city was referred to as Hygeptos in Greek, and that became Egypt in English. But the original name for Egypt was Khem. That's simply called black or dark in their language, it was the black land. And we get the word alchemy, which means again; al - from, it means from the black land, al - Khemet , which is where al-chemy comes from. And that means out of darkness. This knowledge will come and bring light. Because a lot of these mystery tradition teachings do come from Khem, and also the people who took it from khem and started to propagate it in other areas were the Greeks in the Greek mystery traditions. And again, there was light sides and dark sides to all these mystery traditions. there we some who used the knowledge wisely and tried to propagate it and tried to elevate human consciousness and there were those who wanted to use it selfishly for their own benefit and control others.
so, my point was that in the Egyptian mystery tradition they... I lost my train of thought there, I'm sorry. I was talking about how all paradoxes may be reconciled at some level, and I brought up the mystery traditions; I can't remember why I went into that, so I'll just keep going.

#### Slide 75
Let's look at the Principle of Rhythm: everything flows out and in, everything has its’ tides, all things rise and fall. Everything has a rhythm to it or swing to it. There’s tendencies that exist in energy. The pendulum swing manifests in everything that we undergo, everything we perceive. Any measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; it's just an opposite, it's perceived as an opposite. Rhythm will compensate.
how this should be understood when we're talking about Natural Law is that many people will say, “well, that's just the way the tendency is moving us. That's just the way the tide is taking us.” But that's not really accurate. We can't look at these things as; that the rhythms are set in stone, and has to be this way now. One of the things that a lot of the Hermetic tradition taught regarding these laws, these Principles, were that they could be overcome by higher levels of consciousness. This one was one of them.
rhythm is a Principle that is a tendency for something to swing a certain way. Let's liken it to genetics: if you look at some newer biology, a lot of modern biologists are suggesting consciousness plays into whether a gene activates or not and expresses a certain condition. Well, this is the same way; there’s something that can be done about the swing or the tide. Let's look at it as you have a boat, you want to row the boat out to sea. You have to get past the tide, you have to get past the breakers and the waves, and if that tide is really strong at high tide, it's going to be very much more difficult, you're going to have to expend more energy to get it out to sea. If however, you were taking it
when the current’s moving out to sea, there's a flow that's moving outward deeper into the ocean, and you start rowing that boat then, you're going to be able to do that much more easily. So, if there's winds pushing along a plane, it's going to have to expend less energy, it's going to get there more quickly because it's adding to the energy. If however, you're flying against the wind, you gotta expend a lot more energy. It's just a tendency. you can still get to where you want to go; you may just have to exert more effort.
right now, we're in a tendency of: things are not flowing, it's an ebb, and it's something that needs to really have more energy put into it if we're going to resist the tendency. It doesn't mean nothing can be done about it, it doesn't mean it can't be overcome. It means at the time we're living in, we want to make this motion go in this direction, but its tendency is to move in this direction, so more will is required at this time to move the consciousness. At other times, the consciousness may be moving in a positive direction, and it may take much less energy to move that consciousness forward. However, we're not living in that time. We're living in what many researchers have called the “ Kali yuga ” or “the age of darkness and destruction.” This is the point that resists the flow in consciousness the most, and it's going to take an enormity of effort to break down the pre-existing belief systems that don't serve who we are. So, that's the principle of rhythm.

#### Slide 76
This is the Principle here in Natural Law that most fits in with how I'm using the term Natural Law today; Cause and Effect. Many people again, in the new age community don't want to believe that there is causes and effects and that effects are driven by causes that come first, and then manifest conditions. So, the Principle of Cause and Effect simply states that every cause has its effect and every effect has its cause. every single thing that occurs happens according to Law. Chance is a name for a law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes The Law.
so, again, is there free will? Yes there is free will. But is there free will to ignore Law without consequence? No, there is not. That's the limit of free will. Free will is operating within boundary conditions that I'm referring to as Natural Law. It's a series of laws actually. Free will operates within these parameters or boundary conditions that cannot be exceeded or gone beyond without consequence. Oh yeah, you can break natural Law, yes you can break it, but you cannot break it without consequence. You cannot break it without consequence, negative consequence. And that's why this body of knowledge has, in the past, been referred to as Consequentialism. It is the knowledge of how consequences are generated by our free will decision-making processes within the boundaries of Natural Law.
so, this is the Law of Cause and Effect, the Principle of Cause and Effect. And I think this image, I was searching for images that encapsulate cause and effect, and I found this cartoon, and I think it does it brilliantly. Most of all because, will the effect happen immediately? No, it will not happen immediately. There is a time lag. You set the cause into motion; the universe is going to intelligently bring to you though a rearrangement of all the dynamics that it needs to rearrange, the effect of what you have generated by setting that cause into motion, and there is a time gap between the cause going into place
and the effect coming around and hitting you. This is why the pattern recognition of cause and effect is more difficult because it is separated by a time lag, by what we perceive as linear time. Now, if you did a Wrong to somebody and immediately you were stung by a wasp, every single time you did a Wrong to somebody, it showed up and bit you immediately within 2 seconds of you hurting somebody, stealing from somebody, lying to somebody, etc. Would you start to connect the stinging to the Wrong that you did? I think most people would see the pattern, they would recognize the pattern. But since that doesn't happen and there's a time lag to experiencing something harmful to ourselves once we do something harmful to other people, it's very difficult for people to see the connection through the time lag. And moreover, it doesn't exactly happen in a 1 to 1 ratio like this; Karmic consequence is more complicated than all of that.
what's happening is that all of us are experiencing in the aggregate, the Wrongs that the human species is conducting on a daily basis, which we do not attempt to rectify and stop. Through our inaction, karma is being accrued. People think that karma can only be accrued from action- no it cannot. It can be accrued through inaction as well. And that's where many people in our society are, they're not taking any action, and they're willing to let evil run unchecked. So, this is ultimately going to come back and bite us, and what we set into motion is going to actually topple over onto us if we don't change our thoughts, emotions and behaviors. Nothing escapes Law; we are bound by it eternally.

#### Slide 77
Let me just go back and I'll leave it on this slide for a moment. For some people familiar with my work, you’ve seen me break down the Matrix Trilogy, and the law of Cause and Effect is brought forward extensively in the second Matrix movie, The matrix Reloaded. The scene that encapsulates this the most is, the character of the merovingian, who tells to the heroes, who want to be free from the matrix and its control;
“you are coming to me without an understanding of why you are in this position, you don't understand the causal factors that have lead to the current conditions that are in place. Therefore, you are coming to me with no power to effect change; you are powerless. So, why should I help you? You're powerless because you lack knowledge and understanding of what set these events into motion.” Why- the question why. He says, “‘why’ is the only source of real power, without ‘why’ you are powerless.” He's talking about cause and effect and he says specifically; causality, he calls it the only real truth. And this is the villain. The words of truth come through one of the (villains), it's a big technique in Hollywood too; the words of truth are spoken by the villain in the movie, or in the series. But if you listen, and there is a twist, a dark twist to what he says, he says; “free will is like an illusion.” No, it is not. That's where the dark occultist is trying to trip up the heroes. There are both: free will and Natural Law. The Morpheus character says to him, “everything starts with choice,” and Morpheus is correct. Our choices set that causality into motion before it becomes an effect, and the Merovingian tries to tell him “no, there is no free will.” That's where the dark occultist will give you the bulk of truth and then poison it with that one thing that he wants you to accept.
the next thing that needs to be understood is the two planes. There is the plane of effects, and then there is the plane of causes. No power to effect any change lies on the plane of effects, which is the physical manifested reality. Again, what already is, nothing
can be done about. What already is, you cannot change. You cannot change the past. you can change what it is, starting now, and make sure that it gets changed in the future. but, right now, what is, is the truth, and all you can do is accept that or reject it. You can't change the past.
so, the physical world that is manifested up to this point happened because of things that occurred in the past. The causes happened in the past, nothing you can do about that right now. The plane of effects or the physical world is where manifested realities have already occurred, have already taken shape, have already formed, due to their underlying causal factors. The plane of effects constitutes that which has already occurred. As such, no power to affect change lies here, because that which has already occurred cannot un- occur. That which has occurred can't undo itself, it happened, it's already done. It has become that which is, or truth. Human consciousness seems to be trapped upon the plane of effects, meaning that humanity as a whole remains ignorant of the underlying causes which they themselves have set into motion and which lead to self-inflicted suffering in their lives. So, if you're trapped at this level, what you're doing is you're looking at the symptoms, and you're stuck looking at the symptoms. This is everybody; “oh, there's a political solution to this, we need to vote in the right people. Oh, there's a financial solution to this, we just need to set the right monetary policy.” No. “There's a scientific solution to this, and technological advancements are going to be suddenly made that save ourselves and make the world any different.” And they think that all of this is going to be done while slavery is still in place. Well, again, good luck with that and let me know how that works out.
i speak at free energy related events; I work with the Tesla Science Foundation, I speak at mUFON related events that talk about disclosure of extraterrestrial presence. Both of these communities don't understand; the things that they say they want are impossible. and I'm going to start talking about them in this way more openly. Because I've kind of given them some soft teachings and I think they need to hear it a little more harshly, because both of these communities are not talking about morality to the extent that they need to. They think, “we're gonna have free energy,” but nothing's going to change as far as the social structure of the world goes, “we'll just develop free energy, and that'll magically save us. We'll still have slavery, but the free energy will be here, and the world will be a magically better place.” The UFO community; they often think “oh we're gonna get disclosure, they're gonna come out and tell us everything they know about other intelligences that are out there in the galaxy, in the universe with us.” And they think they're gonna get that in a climate of slavery. Well, good luck with all of those things. You've gotta take down the existing structure first.
people think, “Oh, we gotta build the new world while the old one decays.” You have to destroy the existing power structure with the power of truth before anything new is gonna grow here, because this place is a garden full of weeds. Of poisoned ideologies and completely erroneous belief systems that have no bearing on truth what so ever and cannot get us what we say we want. Until those thoughts are changed, don't expect the results you want. So, to the free energy movement, I say, “you're never gonna get free energy in a climate of slavery.” To the UFO community I say, “you'll never get
disclosure in a climate of slavery.” Slavery has to end first, then you can get what you say you want. So, again no power to effect any change lies in the world of effects. cannot be done. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic while it sinks. you're not creating any change doing those things because the underlying causes aren't changing. And the underlying causes are how we think, how we feel, and how we behave. And no one wants to look at that. They want to think “all of those things can stay in place, and I can magically get what I want. I want to keep my hand over the fire, but I don't want it to burn and blister.” Well, enjoy, find out what you get when you do that because that's what we're doing when it comes to Natural Law.

#### Slide 78
Let's look at the plane of causality; this is the other plane, this is the mental realm, the mental world. Again, according to the Law of Mentalism, the first Principle of natural Law: everything that manifests must first manifest in mind before it can manifest physically.
so, again if the plane of causality is the mental world that's generating the causes in the mind, everything is happening there first, and then it is trickling down to the physical domain. It is manifesting in the physical domain only after it has manifested in the mental world. The plane of causality is where causes are set into motion prior to those causes manifesting as formed realities in the plane of effects. This plane of causality constitutes the causal factors, the ‘why,’ which underlies and precedes all manifested things and events. All power, all power to affect change lies on this plane of reality. human consciousness must move away from the plane of effects and to the plane of causality in order for human beings to understand the causal factors of the conditions, which they are collectively manifesting in their lives. Only then will humanity be able to co-create their shared reality on a conscious level, meaning with an understanding of how natural Law operates, rather than on an unconscious level, meaning that we don't understand how Natural Law operates.

#### Slide 79
And I just look at it in a simple graphic, in a simple chart or graph. This is the higher realm; this is the world of causality, the mental world, the ‘why,’ the underlying causal factors that precede conditions which are manifested. This is where our consciousness has to go because this is where all power to affect change is at. In the understanding of why that manifested, to begin with.
so, these are the symptoms (pointing to the plane of effects); this (middle line on the slide), this line could be looked at as the diagnosis, you have to make that diagnosis and get to the underlying causal factors that lead to the symptoms. The plane of effects, on the other hand, meaning the physical world, is the manifested realm; that which has already occurred that cannot be undone, at least in the present moment. You could start in the present to undo it in the future, but as far as the present moment and all moments in the past go, you're not changing that. That's Truth, that's what is, that's already manifested, you can't change it. No power to affect change lies in continuously analyzing the symptoms. You gotta do that long enough that you know where the problem’s at, you've made the diagnosis, now you can get to the causal factors and start going to work on changing those causes. Unfortunately, this plane, the plane of effects, seems to be
where human consciousness in the aggregate is trapped, it can't seem to get past there. even if it recognizes the problem, it wants to keep describing the problem, it wants to keep describing the prison. It doesn't want to look at the causal factors because it's afraid of what the causal factors are. It doesn't want to acknowledge the causal factors lie in how we think, feel and act, and until those things are changed, the external manifestation cannot change. That takes responsibility.

#### Slide 80
The final principle of the 7 Principles of Natural Law, at least the formalized ones, is Gender. Again, I'm going to talk about an 8th lost one. Gender exists in everything. Everything has its masculine and its feminine components or principles. we've already seen that when it comes to the human brain, consciousness, worldview, et cetera. Gender manifests on all planes of existence: spiritual, mental, physical, everything. Very simple concept.

#### Slide 81
What I want to briefly talk about mental gender. Mental gender is the state of co-existence between the masculine and feminine aspects of the mind. Again, we've already looked at this, we looked at the breakdown of the physiology of the brain, at least of the higher-order part of the brain, the neocortex. Our left-brain hemisphere largely facilitates the masculine aspects of the mind, or the intellect, logic, analytical thought, linear thought processes. While the right brain hemisphere largely facilitates the feminine aspect or intuition, meaning creativity, compassion and holistic thought processes.

#### Slide 82
This next section is called The Lost Principle; this is the 8th Principle of natural Law, which binds all of the other principles together. It is what I would call the encapsulating principle. It’s the container inside which all the other principles fit very nicely and neatly. However, it’s lost because we’re not exercising it.

#### Slide 83
See, we already looked at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Principles of Natural Law, and there they are represented by these circles overlapping each other (referring to the slide). Can anybody see an 8th circle anywhere? (Audience response: around the outside) you got it. correct.

Here is the 8th circle, and this might look familiar, you might have seen this somewhere. This pattern is called something, does anybody know what this pattern is called? (Audience response) what is it? Not the flower of life, the seed of life. The seed of life. Now, what happens from a seed? It grows. It generates something, it creates something. A seed has an outer casing, an outer shell. And if you’re gonna get to the inner core of it that contains all of the creative genetic, generative material, that shell has to be there and intact, you break the shell of the seed, the creative essence of the seed is gonna be gone. Now, what is that principle?

#### Slide 84
Here’s what that principle is; it’s the 8th or what I call The Lost Principle, and it’s the thing that has to be present in order for any change to manifest itself. And it is not what most people think of it as. Even when I tell you what this is, I guarantee there will be an inaccurate, connotative meaning for what people think this means.

#### Slide 85
Here’s what the 8th principle is; it is known as the Generative Principle or the principle that governs creation, which actually is the causal factor that goes into effect and generates the result that we say that we want. But what’s the real term for it? Who can guess the actual term, what the generative principle of creation actually is?
(Audience response) no, it is not action. (Audience response: love) okay, now most people will say it’s love. I want to distinguish it from the concept of love, even as I’m going to describe love in this presentation a little bit later on. What is it? (Audience response: co-creation). No. (Responses from the audience), what? Somebody said it. cARE. There it is.

#### Slide 86
The generative principle is CARE.
now, this is different than compassion; people say, “why don’t you use the word compassion?” Because that’s not what I’m talking about. It is a different concept than compassion or even what I would describe as love. CARE, and I mean care with a capital C, and here I didn’t even put it with a capital C, I just put it all uppercase, all uppercase CARE, distinguish this from care with a lower case C. This means; what are you giving attention and helping to grow? What are you focusing upon? Because what you’re focusing upon, that’s what’s ultimately getting generated, getting created and growing. And this doesn’t mean: be ignorant of what’s going on in the world and don’t look at anything that is negative because you’re gonna feed that and give power to it. that’s not what it means. That means; you know what you’re feeding? In that instance, if you wanna do that? You’re feeding ignorance. And that’s what’s gonna grow. It’s the exact opposite that the new agers want you to believe that it is. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it occurs. You are fueling it by ignorance. Ensuring that it grows and takes over. What CARE has to be looked at here as, is; this is what you’re giving your energy to, this is what you’re focused upon, this is what you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to put your attention on, to manifest in the world. That’s what I’m talking about as CARE. That’s what generates our experience, in the aggregate.
most people don’t CARE about what’s really happening. Therefore, it is an impossibility for us in the aggregate, to change the direction of energy, to change the direction of consciousness, and ultimately to get what we say we want. That’s how the real Law of attraction works.

#### Slide 87
Here’s how it actually operates. The Lost Principle is the dynamic of CARE. what we CARE about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions. What did I say that we need to develop? The heart, mind, guts. Heart, mind, guts- in that order. CARE comes first. You’ve gotta care enough to know, to develop the knowledge, then you gotta act on it and put it into practice, apply it. So that’s the order: heart, mind, guts. CARE, knowledge, action. Those are the steps. And all 3 of those have to be in place. All 3, that’s what unity consciousness is. It’s unifying thoughts, emotions and actions: the 3 aspects of consciousness, such that there is no contradiction between them. Our thoughts, what we think, how we feel, and how we act, are one in the
same, there’s no contradiction. That’s unity consciousness. Therefore, since CARE is the driver of our thoughts and actions, it ultimately can be seen as the generator of the quality of our shared experience here on the earth. CARE is the generator of the whole thing, hence it has been called “The Generative Principle.”
liken the heart to a pump in the body; well, what does a pump do? It’s a generator, it provides energy, it moves the life-force through the blood in the body, in every ancient tradition they talked about the life-force being in the blood; the heart is what pumps that through the whole physiology and enables us to continue to sustain life. The heart is the generator, it’s the pump, it’s the center of the being. As important as the brain is, which we just talked about the importance of it, the heart is ultimately what’s generating the experience, because what we care about determines what we think about on a daily basis most of the time, and therefore how we behave. So, this principle has often been referred to as The Generative Principle.
is anybody familiar with the compasses and square symbol in freemasonry, with the G in the middle? Well that’s what the G stands for, at the highest level. They’ll talk about, many porch masons, these are the exoteric masons that are given the teachings of the profane and they think they’re in the know. They’re given the information that “this only means geometry, it only means God, et cetera.” One of the things they’ll tell you at a slightly higher level is that it means gnosis, knowledge, which we saw the meaning of in greek earlier. At a higher level, at illuminated levels of freemasonry, which are above
32nd degree, they will give you what the real meaning of the G inside the compasses and the square is, and it is The Generative Principle, it means genesis. Creation. And yeah, you can tie that right back to God, I’m not saying those things are different and the forms that get created in the physical manifested world are geometric forms, so it is geometry as well, it’s all of these things. But at the highest level, it’s The Generative Principle, that’s what that G really stands for in esoteric freemasonry. It’s called The Generative principle because that means to create. It comes from, the word generative comes from the Latin verb genere , as we’ve already talked about, which means to create.
the Generative Principle is what we create through. And it’s lost because people don’t cARE, they don’t have CARE, hence it’s The Lost Principle. Here’s how it works folks: what we CARE enough to put our will behind. So, again: heart, mind, guts. Guts is the will, the action, the masculine principle- that’s what gets things done ultimately in the physical domain. What we CARE enough to put our will behind. And that’s driven by the CARE. That’s the generator or the pump that drives the will. What we CARE enough to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created or manifested in our world.

#### Slide 88
The world is the way that it is because most people do not CARE enough, even if they say- they pay lip service and say that they want things to be different, they don’t CARE enough to actually change it through their actions. Because again, when it comes all down to it, and I said this in my New Age BS Seminar or lecture, what it comes down to is preventing action. Preventing action: that’s what the new age community is designed to do. They want people inactive because the dark occultists know that the thing that is ultimately generating our reality is behavior. As you saw on that simple 4
part chart, that little building block chart that I put up there. Action is what’s generating the reality. That gets generated through what we CARE about, our CAREs and our desires are what drive our actions. So most people will say they want things to change, but then when you say “what are you doing to make that change happen?” Not a word, silence comes back on the other end. So, they don’t CARE enough to change it through their actions. That’s what The Generative or Lost Principle is about and until that principle is regained and people get out of their laziness, and most of all get out of their cowardice. Again in that new age lecture I’m talking about what it ultimately comes down to in the new age movement, and I’ll look at any new ager in the eyes, they’re cowards, cowards. Ultimately, they know the evil that we’re up against, and they intend to do not a damn thing about it. That’s what it really comes down to, and anybody telling you it’s different than that is lying to you. They’re cowards, period. And I’ll say it right to any of their faces. Anything that I say up here, anybody that believes in that nonsense, come and bring them to me, and I’ll tell them right to their face strait and open just like I said it here because I don’t care. I don’t care about their nonsense, I CARE about what is real. So, I’m telling you, this religion has got to go, it’s got to go if people are gonna make real change happen. The idea that it can be done without taking actual real-world action has to be purged from human consciousness. Reality does not work like that, period the end. And I can’t make you accept that. I recognize I can’t make anybody in this room accept that. All I can do is put it out there for your consideration and if you have some common sense and really, really think about it, you’ll understand what I’m saying is absolutely the way it is. Many people want to deceive you through these religious notions, which is all about getting people to stand down and accept their chains. that’s what that religion’s in place for.
