title: Right vs. Wrong
description: The concepts Right and Wrong are Diametric Opposites of one another. Right and wrong do not merely exist as concepts in the human mind, anybody who believes that is engaged in Satanism, whether they are aware of it or not.
---

This can be explained in a way that's completely unambiguous; if you believe that there is no real difference between right and wrong, and that this concept isn't inherent in Nature, you are accepting a Satanic belief. This is because the second tenet of Satanism is the concept of "Moral Relativism" (left brain imbalance).

## The Pillars of Satanism
There are four main tenets for the ideology of Satanism, also referred to as the "Pillars of Satanism":

## 1. Self Preservation
Is the highest aspiration: If they must step on others to save themselves, they will have no problem doing so.

## 2. Moral relativism
To Satanists there is no such thing as the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. They consider 'right' to be what is 'good for me'
and 'wrong' what is 'bad for me.' And that they themselves can make up the difference between the two, based on their own personal likes and preferences.

## 3. Social Darwinism
A ruling class delegates itself the right to control and direct the masses, because they believe they know better than the rest of humanity.

## 4. Eugenics
A social ideology advocating the promotion of higher rates of sexual reproduction for people with traits and characteristics desired by its proponents - in this case Satanists - and reduced rates of sexual reproduction, or even sterilization for those with undesired traits and characteristics. The word is derived from the Greek adjective 'Eugenes (εύγενής)' which means 'Well-born / of Good stock / of Noble race.' Which is in turn derived from the Greek adjective 'Eu- (εὖ-)' which means 'Good / Well,' and the Greek noun 'Genos (γένος)' meaning 'Birth / Race / Stock.'

::note
Morality is not about right versus left, it's about right versus wrong. 
::

::tip
A deep understanding of morality, and the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of Natural Law.
::

Just as in ancient Rome the word **_Liber_** meant "Book" (Library), and "Free" (Liberty) simultaneously. The word **_Right_** means "Correct" and "Moral" simultaneously, as does **_Wrong_** mean "Incorrect" and "Immoral" simultaneously.


## What a Right Is
So, in the sense of what you "have a right to do", what is a right?

A right is any action in which you are correct and moral in doing so. Every single person has the same rights as the next; not one person has any more rights than another, nor any less rights, at any place, at any time.

## Transcript

### Part 139
now, when I say living in harmony with Natural Law or living in opposition to Natural law, what do I really mean? Well, what this has to do with, is knowledge, and we're gonna keep going back to this trend, this thread, it's not going away.
and guess what? Every time I teach any of this stuff, whenever there’s the new age community around or present, and you'll encounter them from time to time, they’ll insist, you can tell knowledge is becoming a bad word to these people; know. When you say K- n-O-W, know, it's almost like they immediately have an avulsion, an extreme negative reaction, and it is fear but it's mind control moreover. Because they are being fed this poisonous untruth that there's not really any such thing as knowledge and that knowledge is not the way out of this prison. And I'm telling you it goes hand in hand with religious
traditions because they want you to externalize your power, externalize everything. I'm not saying don't have a model for behavior, okay. This person Buddha, you want to pattern your behavior on the Buddha life? Great, live the great life. You want to pattern your behavior on the life of Christ? Whatever. And again, I'm not getting into this discussion here today about the actual historicity of the man Jesus, regardless of what you believe regarding that. I understand, I could write books on astrotheology; I understand that being may never have existed in the way a lot of people believe he did, so what. whether Siddhartha Gautama existed in the form of a man or not, or whether that's an allegory, who cares? Understand the spiritual teachings they were trying to convey to humanity and then apply them in your life. Live by that ethic, that code, great! And have whatever religious notions you want. What I'm saying is: what this religion called the new age movement, and what many official organized regional religions do, is they try to take the emphasis off knowledge. Because again, if you're not seeking truth and trying to develop knowledge, that's how this information remains occult, and that's how the control system stays in place. They want you to externalize your power to a deity or a guru. once you do that, you're accepting your chains; you're saying I have no power. Let me tell you something folks, I’m not powerless, I am full of power. Why? Because I have knowledge of how things actually work. Nobody can tell me I'm owned by somebody else and get me to believe it, because I have understanding of my sovereignty. If they can take that away from you by getting you to de-emphasize the importance of knowledge, of self-knowledge, they own you. That's when you're owned at that point.
knowledge is the way out of this: knowledge, understanding, and then converting that to true wisdom through actions. Not believing in something. Not accepting everything. not waiting on somebody to come down and save you, whether it be Zoroaster, or the aliens from Zeta Reticuli, or Ashtar Command, or Jesus Christ. You keep waiting on an external savior you're gonna be waiting in your chains forever. The knowledge of Truth is what the Christ figure himself proclaimed would be the pathway to true freedom. And whether you put any emphasis on even exoteric Christianity, I'm telling you that's the core of all the mystery traditions; is that until you take in the light, you'll never dispel the darkness. And the light is knowledge of Truth. That's what it has always been symbolized as and represented as.
knowledge is the answer, and here's what the biggest piece of knowledge that comprises natural Law needs to be understood. (Right vs. Wrong) there is a difference, it is a 100% completely polarized antithesis, these are diametric opposites that exist in nature. These concepts: Right and Wrong, do not exist as constructs within the human mind. Anybody who believes that is thrown completely off the path; they are engaged in satanism. Let me just say it just openly right out in a way that is completely unambiguous. If you believe there is no real difference between these things (Right and Wrong) and that they do not exist in nature, you are accepting satanism. It's a satanic belief system that comes directly from dark occultism.
and once again, you can say whatever you want about believing that or not; I was a priest within this religion (satanism). So, if you go up to a Jewish rabbi, and you'd expect he'd have some knowledge of the Judaic tradition, would you not? If you went up to a
catholic priest, you would say, “well, he has some knowledge of Catholicism and how it expresses the Christian tradition,” would you not? You go up to an Islamic Imam, would you accept that this practitioner of his religion, who is in the priest class of his religion would have some knowledge of Islam? Well, I'm telling you I was a priest in satanism! and I'm telling you, the concept of moral relativism is a satanic belief, it is satanic ideology. It's their second tenet. They have 4 pillars. The 4 pillars of satanism are: self- preservation is the highest aspiration, and nothing comes above it. The 2nd tenet is there is no such thing as the objective difference between Right and Wrong. Right is what's good for me, Wrong is what's bad for me personally, and that's it. And I get to make that up based on my likes, preferences and whims. The 3rd tenet is social Darwinism, which is an extension of macro biological Darwinian theory. Social Darwinism: an oligarchy or a ruling class gets to direct the herd “because we know better, and it's just our right to do so because our intellect makes us superior.” And the 4th pillar is eugenics: “since we are ultimately god, we get to decide what's real and what's not real, and we give that perception to the rest of the herd, and we get to decide what's Right and Wrong, well we're god here. And therefore, we get to decide who lives and who dies.” That's the 4 pillars of satanism. And you know how many people believe that nonsense? A whole lot. Way more than people in the priest class of this religion because they are propagating these tenets everywhere in human society. So many people are satanists and do not even know that they are satanists. It is a secret infectious ideology.
i'll tell you a personal anecdote real quick. And I'll tell you who it is now because I don't care anymore. My own grandmother, let's make it personal, and I hope she sees it. My own grandmother who I believe was in her late 70's early 80's at the time, I think she's in her mid 80's now. And I don't speak to her anymore. I took a printed sheet of paper, that i printed out of my printer, printed it out of a laser printer, and I put a little piece of white tape, I taped a piece of white paper over the heading, the title of the document. I asked her to read this, it had 4 paragraphs, and the paragraphs described each of the tenets of satanism very briefly. Self-preservation is the highest law, et cetera et cetera, moral relativism is what we believe in, social Darwinism is what we believe in, and we believe in eugenics. She said to me, “well, I pretty much agree with everything that's written there.” And I said, “you do?” And she said, “yeah, that's how I think. I don't see anything really wrong with it or bad with it.” I said, “okay, peel that little strip of paper off that I've taped to the top, I want you to see what the document is called.” And on the top, it said, “The Tenets of Modern Satanism.” And you know what her response was?
“Well then I guess that makes me a satanist, doesn't it?” Not horrified, not “oh my god, what is my belief system? What do I believe in?” No. “Well, I guess that makes me a satanist, doesn't it?” As if it was just no big thing.
and you know what? You know how many people are in that mindset? Hundreds of millions, if not billions. And don't even understand what it is, because they think satanism is something that it is not. They don't understand what the ideology of satanism is. They think you have to be associated with the trappings of satanism. That you have to dress, as if there is such a thing as dressing like a satanist. Or you have to have certain things on your walls in your house or in your garage if you're a satanist. Well, let me tell you something, satanists are the owners of banks, they own hospitals, they own schools.

(Audience comment: “schools”) yeah, certainly that university right across the road
(Yale). And many people ascribe to this religion in their thoughts, emotions and actions and do not even understand it because they don’t even understand what that belief system is about. They don't understand what that ideology is. They don't know its tenets. So, again, going back to this, if you don't know that there is an objective, meaning: in nature difference, between Right and Wrong, that is a satanic belief system.

### Part 140
Morality: it's not right vs. left; it's about Right vs. Wrong. This whole left- right paradigm that people are, “oh are you fall in with the left, the Democrats or the right, the Republicans?” It has nothing to do with any of that, it's a false paradigm. The thing that all of that's a distraction for not getting you not to pay attention to and understand is the difference: the real, true and objective difference between Right and wrong. And we're gonna explore what that is because it can be known. It can be known, and most people will be shocked and horrified to understand the real differences between right and Wrong because they'll have to look into themselves and recognize in many ways that they are cooperating with Wrong. And that they don't really truly know the difference between Right and Wrong.
when you tell people this, I'm telling you, I told this to somebody in a bar once which is a big mistake of even trying to bring up this discussion in that environment, but occasionally even I make asinine mistakes like that and think I'm going to be talking to an even semi-consciousness being, when you're talking to a block. So, I said, “you understand what actual morality is, is true common sense?” We're gonna look at that term common sense and explore what it really means. And she said “so what you're saying is if I think that there's no really objective Right and Wrong that I don't have common sense?” And I said “that's not what I think, I'm trying to explain to you that that's what it means by definition, not by what I think.” The definition of common sense is to truly know the difference between Right and Wrong. And I said, “because I say that you are not fully in that state of awareness, don't even take it personally because billions of people on the earth are in that same state of awareness. You're not special, and it's not a personal attack against you.” And I thought this person was gonna throw a glass at me. literally, got so enraged because she's associating the concept of common sense with: that you are functional and can adequately perform the daily activities of living. And that's not what I'm talking about as common sense, having common sense about “oh, I can prepare my meals and eat for myself, and wash my own clothes, and go to work.” that's not what I'm talking about as common sense, that's your everyman’s definition or connotation of common sense.
we're gonna talk about what common sense really is. A deep understanding of morality, which are the principles concerning the distinction between Right and Wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of Natural Law. This is the essence of it, folks, right here.

### Part 141
And here's the difference between Right and Wrong in a nutshell, about as simply as I am capable of describing it. Now, we use the words “correct” or “right” to mean correct and moral. When you say, “okay, what's 5 plus 5?” It's 10, “you're right!” meaning: you are correct, that is true, that is the correct answer, that is right. And then
we say, “Was stealing that money from Jim, was that right?” To mean; was it a moral behavior? So, now, why would we use the same word, again, the ancient Romans used the same word for “book” and “free,” those 2 different concepts were represented by the same word liber. And there's a reason: because reading will put you on the path to true freedom if you read the right books. Why would in English, in the English language we do not really have other words to mean the same concepts, but the word “right” means 2 things simultaneously. It means both correct and it means moral. There's a reason because they mean the same thing.
correct is moral. Correct meaning that it is in alignment with that which is true means literally by definition: if it is true, then it is moral. The more you are following something that is false, that is not based in truth, the more you are going down the path of immorality, of Wrong doing. So, we have to come to know what is true regarding Right and Wrong if we are going to be able to correctly, with wisdom, choose between these 2 modalities of behavior. So, Right, again means both correct, which is based in truth, and moral, which means that the action, if taken, if acted upon, is in harmony with Natural law. Actions based in it do not result in harm to other sentient beings. That's the definition of Right. Look at how simple that definition is and think about it for a moment. We're talking about what is A Right. Meaning, what do you have a Right to do? And what you have a Right to do is no different than what I have a Right to do. what I'm telling you here is: every single human being on this planet has the exact same rights. Not one person has one more Right than another being; not one person has one less Right than another being. To think that anybody has more or less Rights anywhere on the earth, at any time in history, is a fallacy: it is a lie, it is a deception, it is Wrong, it is not correct, it is not based in truth. Rights are universal, and the exact same for every human being. Blanket statement, absolute truth. Let the ego chew on it and deal with it. and again, the ego will have a hard time with this in many cases, with many people. they'll hear that and want to throw a glass at me.
so, look at the definition again: A Right, when you make a definition, this is a noun, a noun is a person, place or thing in the English language, we're talking about a noun here. you look up the word right, it's a noun, meaning A Right. A Right that we have to enact, to take, is an action. You have to start a definition with the same type of word. You're defining a noun; you gotta give it a noun to start the definition. A Right is an action; most people will never even be able to tell you that. Just say, “Can you define what a right is to me?” They will not give you this noun. A Right is an action, so is A Wrong an action. A Right is an action that if you take it, it does not cause harm to other sentient beings. That's the simple and easiest definition that anybody can give for what a Right is. and I guarantee you, you go and engage as many people as you want on the street, I have not asked this question and had anybody ever raise their hand, or even contact me later and say “ you go up to somebody on the street and ask them what they can define what a right is,” nobody can give you the correct definition for what a Right is.
now if you don't know what the definition of a Right is, you certainly don't know whether you are choosing accurately between a Right and a Wrong, between Right and wrong behavior. You can't; it's not possible. So many people believe that they are
allowed and they can do actions with no consequence that actually aren't in alignment with Natural Law because the taking of those actions do result in harm. And they don't really even understand that.
so, let's look at what a Wrong is, and we're gonna deeply look into what a Wrong is, we're going to focus on what Wrongs are, because in reality, to even start this (moral actions), what have we based this definition on? Actions based in it do not result in harm. That's the negative of another definition; well, it's the negative of this definition
(immoral actions). So, you can only actually define a Right by knowing what a Wrong is. A Right technically cannot be defined outside of the negative. A Right can only be defined apophatically, meaning understanding what a Wrong is, and then stating that it is anything that falls outside of the parameters of Wrongdoing. And we're going to get to what those parameters are. I want to focus on Wrong for a moment. Wrong, again we say this: “What's 5 plus 5? 9.” Wrong. It's not true, incorrect, incorrect answer. It's not based in truth. We use the term Wrong to mean both incorrect and immoral. “That was wrong what you did to that person, by hitting him for no reason. You didn't have the right to do that.” Immoral means in opposition to Natural Law, because actions that are based in it result in harm to other sentient beings. That's the simple definition of a wrong. Now we can go, we can go deeper into the definition of what a Wrong is, and look at different types of Wrongs, which is what I'm going to do in a moment.
