**The three main complexes that comprise the human brain are:**

1. The R-Complex (Reptilian Brain): Basic survival functions
2. The Limbic system (Mammalian Brain): Human emotion
3. The Neocortex (Human Brain): Higher thought functions and consciousness

## R-Complex
The R-Complex becomes active when we are in 'fight-or-flight' mode; when survival is at stake. This part of the brain also controls basic motor skills and respiration. It is comprised of the brain stem and the cerebellum. It is the lowest conscious part of the brain, meaning it is not a “thinking” part of the brain, merely a part of the brain that reacts to stimulus.

## Limbic system
The Limbic system, also referred to as the 'mid-brain,' makes it possible for us to feel in our physical realm. It does this by releasing neuropeptides into the bloodstream via different glands that comprise the limbic system, for example: the pineal gland, the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland etc. It is the part of our brain which makes all human emotions possible. If this particular part of the brain would not function properly, you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions.

This is partially what psychopathy is; with psychopaths this part of the brain does not function properly. Which could be due to some form of birth disorder, or from chronic conditions in somebody's life which have “numbed” this particular part of the brain.

## Neocortex
The Neocortex is structurally the highest part of the brain, and evolutionary the newest part of the brain. The word 'Neo' derives from the Greek adjective 'Néos (νέος)' which means 'New.' It's where all the electrochemical activity that comprise our 'human modes of thought' take place; that which we consider the things in thought that make us human, and separate us from the animal kingdom. By higher thought functions is meant, for example: logic, intuition, creativity etc. It is essentially the outer layer of the brain's grey matter. As far as evolutionary development of the human brain goes, it is the newest part of our brain structure.

## Brain Hemispheres

The brain structure also include two hemispheres which are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning they are able to be divided into approximate mirrored images of each other along the midline. The two separate halves generally control different functions of the brain.

## Left Brain
The left hemisphere is the intellectual part of the brain (masculine): logic, analytical thought, math etc.

## Right Brain
The right hemisphere is the intuitive part of the brain (feminine): creativity, intuition, compassion etc.

When there is a healthy balance between the two hemispheres of the brain, that's when real consciousness, and pattern recognition is developed. As well as true morality, and ethical consideration.

## Intellect ≠ Intelligence
Intellect is not the same as intelligence. Intellect is left brain understanding; while intelligence is holistic understanding, with the right brain included in the process.

The word **_Intelligence_** is made up of **_Intelli_** + **_Gence_**. The "Intelli" part derives from the word "Intellect", and "Gence" comes from the Latin verb **_Gignere_** which means "to Generate, to Create, or to Bring forth". So, intellect + creativity, or logic + compassion etc., that is real intelligence; holistic intelligence. Sadly, most people in our society are not holistically intelligent, they are usually in some form of either left- or right brain imbalance.

## Brain Imbalance
If the left brain becomes chronically dominant, the R-Complex will take over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by selfishness and base desires. They usually develop a personality based on domination and control.

If the right brain becomes chronically dominant, the Limbic System takes over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by their own emotions. They usually develop a personality based on submissiveness and naiveté.

### Transcript

#### Slide 51
So, let's pick up where we left off. I was talking about brain structure and human behavior and how these two things are completely interrelated. Brain health plays a critical role in human behavior. So, it’s extremely important for human beings to become familiar with the brain's basic structure and function. Now, I'm not telling you that this is the totality of neuroscience, what I'm going to show you here today. I'm saying that this is the basics; it's the essence of how the brain structure works. So, this is part of understanding the physiological aspects of how consciousness works.

so, there's three main complexes; structures that comprise the total human brain. The first is the R-complex or the reptilian brain. This part of the brain facilitates basic survival functions. It's the part of the brain that goes to work and becomes active when we're in what's called fight or flight mode when survival is at stake. It also controls basic motor functions and respiration. The second part of the brain is above the R-complex. this is called the limbic system. It's also known as the mammal brain, the mammalian brain. This part of the brain facilitates human emotions and it makes human emotion possible to be felt in the physiology. It does this by releasing what's known as neuro peptides into the bloodstream through different glands that comprise the limbic brain, or what's called the midbrain also.

the final part of the brain, the highest structure, structurally, and the newest part of the brain evolutionarily is called the neocortex. Now really what this part of the brain is called is the telencephalon. That's what we traditionally think of as the gray matter of the brain, with the hemispheres. The neocortex is where all of the actual electrochemical activity that comprises our human modes of thought takes place. And that's in the outer shell of the telencephalon, which is known as the neocortex. So, this part of the brain actually facilitates all human functions of thought what we consider the things in thought that make us a human being and separate us from the animal kingdom: higher thought functions, logic, intuition, creativity. So, we'll break down these parts of the brain and give you some visual understanding of them.


#### Slide 52
Down here is the reptilian brain. It's comprised of the brainstem right here and this part of the brain is called the cerebellum. These two components together essentially comprise the R-complex. So again, the R-complex is the lowest consciousness part of the brain. We don't do any thinking with this part of the brain, it’s the reactive part of the brain. It reacts to stimulus it's the stimulus response mechanism. now up here in this middle part of the brain, these are all the different glands like the hypothalamus, the thalamus, the pituitary and pineal glands, et cetera, that comprise the midbrain or the limbic system. All human emotions are facilitated or made possible by this part of the brain. Okay? So, this part of the brain, if it wasn't working properly, you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions.

This is part of what psychopathy is, with psychopaths this part of the brain is not functioning properly. Whether it be from a birth disorder or whether it be from conditions over one's life, that if someone has stayed in chronically has numbed out this part of the brain and is not functioning properly anymore, so the person's not actually experiencing a normal range of emotions. This part of the brain, which again, is the telencephalon, this gray matter part with all the grooves, et cetera, that's the neocortex. the neocortex is the outer casing basically of the telencephalon the higher brain. It's the human brain. Neo means new. So it's the newest part of the brain structure, as far as the evolutionary development of the human beings goes. So, this part of the brain facilitates all higher order thinking.


#### Slide 53
Now, what do you have to understand about the telencephalon, or the hemispheres of the brain, is that they're first of all bilaterally symmetrical, and they generally control different functions of thought. I'm not telling you it's 100%; neuroscience is more complicated than that. But in general, the left part, the left hemisphere of the brain is what governs logic, analytical thought, and scientific and mathematical thinking, and also linear thought processes. Physical world tasks and details, being able to break things down and analyze them. Alright. So, this is taking things apart, breaking them down into smaller components and analyzing the pieces- that's what the left-brain does. You can look at it as a series processor. It has to go into this part first, then here and then here, and then we can spit out the output; a linear process, like a series processor. The right-side of the brain, the right hemisphere, governs or generally facilitates and makes possible human creativity, our emotional makeup, all the emotional dynamics of the human being. Holistic thought, being able to see the big picture; big picture thinking, pattern recognition, and then things like compassion, nurturing, care, ethics to a large extent. I would say ethical thinking comes from a balance between the two, as we're going to get into.

Now, if this left part of the brain, here, becomes chronically dominant, the masculine part of the brain. And again, I'm putting these symbols here: this is an ancient archetypal symbol called the blade; it's a simple upward-pointing triangle. And this downward pointing triangle is another ancient archetypal symbol that was referred to in the ancient world as the chalice, the cup, etc. This was a rudimentary phallic symbol and this was a rudimentary womb symbol, representing the male and the female, or the masculine and feminine more accurately, components of the consciousness.


#### Slide 53.1
The idea is to keep a balance between these two. When we have a balance between these two, that's when we're operating on all cylinders, so to speak. That's when real consciousness and pattern recognition is developed, and that's when real morality and ethical considerations are also created within the personality within the being. If this part of the brain is chronically dominant, the left part of the brain, what happens is the right- side of the brain is imbalanced. It's not really functioning at a higher level, and the limbic brain will actually suffer that effect, it will also start to shut down. So, you will have a lot of left-brain patterns going on and a lot of left-brain processing going on. But if that's all that's happening and we're not using this part of the brain equally, the R-complex of the brain is what essential executive functions are going to be routed to. We're gonna be living from the R-complex in a kind of stimulus-response only mode instead of living from a holistic brain balanced mode. Which is, when we're in that balanced state, the neocortex which governs higher-order thinking and makes higher-order thinking and ethical thinking possible is what rules the personality.

Now conversely, if the right side of the brain is chronically dominant, so let’s put it this way; the left side of the brain being chronically dominant you have the controller, that's the master mentality, the right side of the brain being chronically dominant; that's the slave mentality. That's the “I won't stand up for myself and I'll just accept everything,” the total new ager in other words. So this part of the brain if it's chronically dominant the opposite happens with the structures of the brain; the R-complex will shut down, it will suffer, it will not work properly, which the R-complex is necessary. It makes you stand up for yourself when you're under attack. Again it's the fight-flight response. In a dangerous situation you gotta know if you're gonna fight whatever is attacking you or whether you're gonna “get outta dodge” and run away. That's a survival mechanism that's necessary when there’s danger. When this part of the brain is chronically imbalanced, the R-complex gets shut down, people freeze essentially, and they don't stand up for themselves and take action. What's happening is they're being ruled by their emotions, and again the limbic brain governs all emotions: positive and negative, so that's compassion, and that's fear; it's any possible human emotion. The midbrain is what’s ultimately facilitating that emotion and physiology. So, if this part of the brain is chronically dominant, the opposite happens: you go into slave think, you shut down, you freeze, you're ruled by the emotions, and you don't stand up for yourself.

#### Slide 54
So, the neocortex of the brain has two hemispheres, the left-brain hemisphere largely facilitates logic and scientific thought, while the right-brain hemisphere largely facilitates creativity and compassion. When both hemispheres are in balance, the neocortex acts in its proper role as the executive command center of the whole human brain, and that's when true intelligence is born. Now, true intelligence is a concept that I think more people really have to understand. People have equated intelligence with intellect, especially in the western society. Intellect is not intelligence; let me say that again, intellect is not intelligence. Intelligence comprises more than intellect. Intellect is left-brain understanding. True intelligence is holistic understanding with the right-brain included in the process: the nurturing, compassionate, creative, and intuitive sides of the consciousness together with the intellectual aspect of consciousness. And you can see this in the word: in-telli-gence. Intelli is where intellect comes from, and gence comes from the Latin verb genere, genere means to generate or to create. So, it's the creative aspect of the personality or the right-brain. So, intellect plus creativity, logical thinking plus nurturing and compassion, that's real intelligence, holistic intelligence and most people in our society are not in holistic intelligence, they are in one form of brain imbalance or the other.

#### Slide 55
Let's look at how this manifests. If a human being’s left-brain hemisphere becomes chronically dominant, the R-complex will take over executive function of the brain and the person will become ruled by selfishness and base desires, and they will develop a personality that is based in domination and control.

#### Slide 56
Conversely, if a human being’s right brain hemisphere becomes chronically dominant, the limbic system will take over executive function of the whole brain and the person will become ruled by their own emotions and develop a personality that is based in submissiveness and naiveté. The slave-think mentality.
