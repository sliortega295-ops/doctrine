The states of Self Loathing and Self Respect cannot exist simultaneously, for they are contradictory psychological conditions.

## Self Loathing
Self-loathing is the underlying psychological condition that causes people to attempt to abdicate their own personal responsibility to exercise conscience, and fall into patterns of order-following and justification. Just as it is not possible for an order-follower to truly be exercising conscience; it is also not possible for an order-follower to truly love themselves.


Self-loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been buried into the subconscious mind, instead of being confronted, dealt with, and healed. Such trauma could form feelings of inadequacy; whether they are real, suggested, or simply imagined. A mind-set as such is a psychological prison, and yet, people suffering from self-loathing
usually don't seem to have any desire for true freedom - **They are in the cage, and they love being in the cage.**

::tip
The only kind of people that have no desire for real freedom, are people in the psychological state of self-loathing, that do not love themselves.

## Self Respect
Self-respect heals self-loathing. It is about introspection (observation or examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotional state).

The word **_Respect_** is derived from the Latin prefix **_Re-_** which means "Again" and the Latin verb  **_Spectare_** which means "to Look at, or to Take another look at oneself". This is where true respect starts.

You cannot give somebody something that you don't already own yourself. If you don't have $10,- in your pocket you could impossibly give it to someone else. You must obtain it first, before you can give it away. Therefore, nobody can give respect to anybody else unless they first developed it inwardly.

Self-respect must come first, which is why people in the state of self-loathing don't respect anybody, least of all themselves. Only self-respect can heal self-loathing, and therefore help put an order-follower on the path to exercising conscience.

## Transcript

### Part 230
And again, there’s a reason for this. This is the underlying psychological reason but there’s an even deeper one, but I’m gonna touch on this one first. Self-Respect vs. Self- loathing.


### Part 231
People who don’t want to take personal responsibility and become an adult are in this psychological condition. It’s called self-loathing. What it means is you hate yourself. Nobody who wants to perpetuate slavery can possibly like themself, they cannot love themselves. It’s impossible. You are already in a state of self-hatred if you believe in government, if you believe in its legitimacy. Because you believe in slavery and therefore, you’re in that slavery system and you want it to continue. How can you possibly love yourself, it’s not possible. Self-loathing is the underlying psychological condition that causes people to attempt to abdicate their own personal responsibility to exercise conscious, and fall into patterns of order-following and justification. Just as it is not possible for an order-follower to truly be exercising conscious, it is not possible for an order-follower to truly love themselves. These two states cannot exist simultaneously. you cannot be an order-follower and love yourself, it is impossible. They are contradictory psychological conditions.


### Part 232
Here’s what a self-loathing person really is; they’re trapped in a trauma, abuse, victim cycle. A trauma happens, there’s an abuser, there’s a victim and then it repeats itself because often the one who’s abused becomes the traumatizer and then the cycle repeats again. I’ve talked about this pretty extensively on my podcast series.

(Pointing to the slide image) this is a gollum creature: it’s a 100% programmed and lifeless thing that is imbued with the ability to actually move like a robot. You can liken it to a flesh robot and it’s a concept in ancient dark occultism. The gollum is driven by the force of self-loathing and that’s what the order-followers are, they’re gollums. I’m not saying this to insult people, I don’t really care how people take it, I’m telling them what they really are and what the dark occultists think of them. They call them their dogs and their pets; that’s their name for the police and military. I did a whole series on that and I’m not telling you that from book knowledge, I’m telling you that from their lips to my ears; that’s what they call them. The gollum is in this mindset: “since I have suffered, i will cause suffering to others. Since I can’t deal with my nested psychological traumas and childhood issues and inadequacy issues, I’m going to take out all of that nested subconscious psychological frustration on other people I have no Right to take it out upon.” That’s the gollum mindset.
self-loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been suppressed and buried deeply into the subconscious; that ‘s the role of the subconscious, to protect the conscious mind from traumatic experiences so that the conscious mind doesn’t keep re-living it and therefore re-experiencing it in the physiology. However, if we never bring up that shadow material to the conscious level, it builds and builds and builds until it ultimately destroys us psychically and spiritually. Instead of confronting, dealing with, and healing that trauma, people don’t want to do that work, it’s too hard to dredge up that shadow material, it’s hard work. Believe me, to come out of the mind-state I was in, I had to do that shadow work for years. Years of more suffering and pain, saying what do I have to look in the mirror and confront about myself and then work to change and admit thousands and thousands and thousands of times I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong. i don’t know how many thousands of times I had to look in the mirror and say that to myself. Sometimes to a point where I was so depressed I couldn’t get out of bed for days. I would just sit and lay in bed and play doom metal all day. Literally, endlessly, repetitively, and just sitting there in that condition of total self-loathing and total depression because what I know I took a part in and that I know was still my mental makeup, was still my psychological makeup that was going to take years to get out of. and I’m trying to explain this to prevent people from having to go through all that suffering. This knowledge can be gleaned without having to go down that path. It can be done. I’m not telling you that’s easy work, but it is possible. Such trauma could take the form of feelings of inadequacy whether they are real or imagined.


### Part 233
You know what that mind-state ultimately is? It’s self-prison; it’s somebody putting themself in a cage. These people who want to take out their psychological frustrations on other people, they’re prisoners. They are in the cage and they love being in the cage. They don’t have any desire for freedom. The only kind of person that would have no desire for real freedom is a person who’s in the psychological state of loathing and hates themself and does not love themself.


### Part 234
Now, what heals self-loathing? Self-respect and we have to know what the word respect means. This is about looking at yourself. Introspection. Respect comes
from the Latin re , meaning again, and the Latin verb spectare , which means to look at. you put them together: to look at again, to take another look at. Well what are you taking another look at? You’re taking another look at yourself. That’s where respect starts at. You can’t give something to somebody that you don’t have. If I don’t have ten dollars in my pocket, I can’t give it to you. If I don’t have a coin in my pocket I can’t give it to somebody else. You got to have it first to give it. So nobody can give respect to anybody else unless they first develop it inwardly. Self-respect has to come first, and that’s why these people (order-followers) don’t respect anybody, most of all themselves. until they do that work of self-introspection, they’re not going to develop that self- respect. Again, I’m not telling you that’s easy work, it’s hard work that can take a lot of time and it’s dredging up shadow material that most people want to run away from. They don’t want to confront that about themselves.


### Part 235 skipped in video
Only self-respect can heal self-loathing and therefore help to put an order-follower on the path to conscious. We need to take another look at ourselves.
