::tip
As morality increases, freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.

## Inverse Proportions
Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of people in any given society, is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and morality there is, the less tyranny and slavery there will be within that society.

## True Freedom
True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces Moral Relativism, the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, thinking that humanity may arbitrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.

## Transcript

### Part 173
the Law of Freedom. This is one of the basic Laws within the body of Natural Law.

### Part 174
It's real simple. The Law of Freedom states that freedom and morality are directly proportional. It's a mathematical equation that works 100% of the time flawlessly. As morality increases, freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines. This means the more moral a population is, the freer it becomes. The more immoral a population is, the deeper into bondage and slavery it goes. Another way of saying this is to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of the people of any given society is always inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more truth and morality there is, the less tyranny and slavery there is. the less truth and morality there is, the more tyranny and slavery there is. That's the Law of Freedom. And many people don't want to understand that; that these two things are inextricably interwoven and connected and can never be separated from each other: the presence of truth and morality in a society and the presence of freedom or its lack in a society.

### Part 175
True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces moral relativism, which is the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between Right and wrong. So, humanity may just arbitrarily create or decide Right and Wrong for themselves. That's the ideology called moral relativism, as I've said before, is the second tenant of the satanic religion, and it is deeply entrenched in this country and in the world. in our polls that we conducted the psychological, little tabulations that we did, asking several people questions: two-thirds of people are moral relativists. 66%, think about that. Two out of three people believe there's no such thing as an objective difference between Right and Wrong, and feel these are just constructs that exist by human beings, and we get to make up what's Right and what's Wrong. Two-thirds of people, that's where we're at. That's where we're really at.
