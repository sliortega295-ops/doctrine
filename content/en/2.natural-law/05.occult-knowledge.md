## Transcript

### Part 17
This knowledge is occulted, meaning hidden. How many people came here today thinking that they were going to hear information about the occult, by a show of hands? About half the room, good. For the rest of the people that may come as a shock, but what you have to understand right off the bat is that the word occult is simply derived from Latin, the Latin adjective occultus. Occultus in Latin means hidden, hidden from sight and it’s derived from the Latin noun oculus , which means eye. The word ocular in english means related to the eye or related to sight, or vision. So what the occult is, it is a body of knowledge that has been hidden away for a specific reason, and we’re gonna get into what that reason is. From the term oculus, or eye in Latin, comes the verb occultare. Occultare means to hide, to conceal, or to keep secret, to keep hidden from the eye so that it cannot be seen. The information regarding Natural Law is occulted knowledge. It is knowledge that has been hidden from humanity. It’s held by the few, which is represented here at the top of this pyramid. You could look at this as a pyramid representing knowledge or ignorance. at the top of the pyramid you have knowledge. The higher you go in the pyramid, the more knowledge, but the pyramid tapers because at the top, very few people understand that information. Very few people have that knowledge and have actually integrated it into themselves to the point where it becomes understanding. Down here, you have no knowledge, the ignorant masses and up here you have the people who are in the know, who have this knowledge about how Natural Law works, and are actually using it for a certain reason. We’re going to get to that next what that that is. So please, as you go through this seminar, please keep in mind; if I ever use the term occult, all I’m talking about here is hidden knowledge. That’s what it means. Occulted knowledge is hidden.


### Part 18
Now why would anybody want to hide knowledge that is extremely important? Well there’s a very specific reason, but before we even get to that we have to talk about what is this occulted knowledge. What is the body of knowledge? What does it comprise? When I’m saying the occult, the knowledge of the occult, what do I mean by that? Occult knowledge constitutes two things, there’s two general bodies of occult knowledge. In the actual mystery traditions and in occult schools, they talk about these as arcana. The word arcana is also Latin; it means knowledge, that’s all it means. So there’s two bodies of knowledge; there’s one body of knowledge in the occult called lesser arcana or the minor arcana. This means the knowledge of the microcosm, the knowledge of the small things. It doesn’t mean it’s less important, it means it’s dealing with the individual units of consciousness, the human psyche, the psyche of the individual.
