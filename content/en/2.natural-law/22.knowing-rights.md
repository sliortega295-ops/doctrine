title: Knowing Rights
description: Rights are most easily understood when they are considered through Apophatic Inquiry
---

This process helps us to understand what a right actually is, by understanding which actions are not rights because they cause harm to other sentient beings.

The word **_Apophasis_** is derived from the Greek noun **_Apophanai_** (απόφασις) which means "to Speak off". This is a method of logical, deductive reasoning, that is employed when given a limited set of possibilities, in which we gain knowledge about something by excluding the known negatives, or by setting the logical inconsistencies to the side.

In other words, describing what something is, by explaining what it is not.

So, this is the concept that is referred to as apophatic inquiry; very, very critical to understand concept, and you have to apply this concept. What this essentially is, is it's a filtration process. This is the process of the middle process in the Trivium; it's weeding through the inconsistencies and saying, “well, is this inconsistent? Is this inconsistent? Is that not true?” And you're setting those behaviors aside and you’re saying, “Here's the behaviors that are Wrong, don't engage in those behaviors.” It's negative: it's a negative process, it's a destructive process. You're taking away from the body of everything that can be done, and you're saying, “I'm pulling these out through a weeding down process.” And saying, “These are inconsistent with truth.” It's called apophasis. Apophatic inquiry. And that is to be delineated from what’s known as cataphatic inquiry. Cataphatic inquiry means you are reasoning in the affirmative, and you're not trying to weed down through a process of elimination to get to the truth. So, cataphasis or cataphatic inquiry would be equivalent to inductive reasoning, whereas apophatic inquiry or apophasis would be akin to deductive reasoning. Right's are most easily understood when they are considered through apophatic inquiry or what is known as the process of apophasis. This process helps us to understand what a Right actually is by understanding which actions are not Rights because they cause harm to others; they are the cause of harm.

Here's what apophasis is: it’s been called apophatic inquiry, really look this up, understand what apophasis is because it’s part of the Trivium process. It comes from the Greek noun apophasis , written there in Greek script, which comes from the Greek
verb apophanai. So, apo in Greek means away from or the negation of, and phanai in greek means to say or to speak. So, when we put them together, it means to “say no” or
“not to say” or to say what something is not, in other words. That's what apophasis is.
you're saying, “This is not this, it's the opposite of that.” So, it is a method of logical reasoning or deductive reasoning that is employed when you are given a limited set of possibilities, in order to arrive at knowledge, arrive at knowledge by way of the exclusion of known negatives. You're setting the logical inconsistencies to the side and saying,
“This is not what this thing is.” That's called apophasis. You are describing what something is by explaining what it is not. This is called “Affirmation through negation,” is another term that this truth discovery process is known as.
