title: Moral Culpability
description: The Objective Assignment of Responsibility for Harm, from Thought to Action

## Definition
Moral culpability is the determination of who is ultimately at fault, or deserving of blame for
the commission of actions which resulted in harm or loss for others.

## Etymology
The word **_Culpable_** means "at Fault, or Deserving of blame", it is derived from the Latin noun **_Culpa_** which means "Fault, or Blame".

::note
The people that act out a certain behavior and cause harm, loss, chaos or trauma to others
always carry blame.
::

**Who actually carried out the holocaust in Germany?**  
The people that followed the orders to do so; therefore, order-followers is the answer. And they are always in the form of police or military; this is why a totalitarian state is referred to as a "Police State." Because they are the people ultimately responsible for bringing that condition into manifestation through their behavior.

## Police State
The order giver (president,  mayor, judge etc.) makes a command, the order-follower obeys without question, and through their behavior make that condition a reality; that"s why it"s called a police state. Because every police state that has ever existed, has
always been created by police following orders. Because they don't want to think for themselves, they don't want the personal responsibility and they don't want to truly know the difference between right and wrong for themselves, like a responsible adult person would.

Note that the term "MORE" is underlined and capitalized; the order givers are also morally culpable, that is not the question. The question is “Who is MORE morally culpable?” The answer is always the order-follower, at any time, in any place.

The people on the left aren't the actual cause of what happened on the picture in the middle; all they did was sign some pieces of paper, and told the people on the right: “Go and bomb/shoot/kill these people” and they said “Yes, sir” and went right ahead and committed whatever wrong-doings they were commanded, without questioning at all if what they had been ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

The order-follower always bears more moral culpability that the order-giver, because the order-follower is the one who actually performed the action, and in taking such action, brought the resulting harm into physical manifestation. Order-following is the pathway to every form of evil and chaos in our world. Again, it should never be seen as a virtue by anyone who considers themselves a moral person. Order-followers have ultimately been personally responsible and morally culpable for every form of slavery and every single totalitarian regime that has ever existed.

## Transcript

### Part 219
moral Culpability. What does this mean?

### Part 220
The Determination of who is ultimately at fault, or deserving of blame. again, this is a legitimate and real concept; there is fault, there is blame. We got to get over this new age nonsense that nobody’s at fault, nobody’s to blame, we should never say “hey you shouldn’t have done that, that caused a lot of chaos and trauma for other people, you’re not to blame, it just happened.” No, wrong. The people who did the behavior are to blame. Who carried out the holocaust in Germany? The people who followed their orders to do it. That’s who carried it out: order followers is the answer. who carried out the purge of political dissidence in Soviet Russia? Order-followers. and they’re always in the form of police. Why do you think they call a totalitarian system a police state? Why don’t they call it a banker state? How come they don’t call it politician state? What about a lawyer state? How about a judge state? What not call it any of those things? You want to know why? Because none of those people are ultimately responsible for bringing that condition into manifestation through their behavior. They’re the order-givers. The order-followers carry out their commands and through their behavior make that condition a reality. That’s why it’s called a police state because every police state that has ever existed has always been created by police, who follow their orders because they don’t want to take responsibility and think for themself and know the difference between Right and Wrong for themself like an adult. Instead, I want to be a child who obeys daddy because I have daddy issues. And that’s what it’s really about folks, we’re going to get to that. There is such a thing as blame for the commission of actions which have resulted in harm or loss to others. This is what culpable means: it comes from the Latin culpa meaning fault or blame, it means at fault
or deserving of blame.

### Part 221
Now, who’s more morally culpable, the order-giver or the order-follower? and please recognize I’ve underlined and capitalized the term more. I’m not telling you the order-givers are not morally culpable, they are, that’s not the question. “Are any of these people morally culpable” is not my question. My question is, look at the full question: who is MORE morally culpable, the order-giver or the order-follower? (Audience answers: order-follower) Always. Always, at all times and places, at all times and places.

### Part 222
I put this meme up on Facebook and I mean I got some hate back for it. people don’t want to hear this. Like I said, I’m not here to be popular and make friends. i’m here to tell people what the truth actually is and they have to accept it or reject it on their own. I made this meme and put it up on Facebook. It has politicians on the left and said, “my actions (underlined and capitalized) didn’t cause that.” And then there was some soldiers or marines, whatever they are, order-followers, on the right side, and they’re also saying the same statement: “my actions didn’t cause that.” And at the top I put this question: who is lying and who is telling the truth? So who’s lying here? If people can’t see, I hope that they can see this horrific picture; this is the result of bombings that took place in the Middle East I think around Iraq and it’s a father carrying his dead child in his arms. Maybe if bombs were raining down on our children we might think differently about going in and waging imperialism on other nations, I don’t know, maybe we might think differently about it. But when it happens to somebody else’s child, that’s ok, that’s done in the name of freedom. Well, who caused this (pointing to the horrific picture)? Did they cause it (pointing to the picture of the order-givers)? No they didn’t cause it. They are not the actual cause of this, because you what all they did (was)? They signed some pieces of paper, wearing their expensive suits and they told these guys, they said “well, you’re under our orders now, go and bomb these people.” and you know what these people did (order-followers); they said yes sir and go and drop the bombs and fire off the ammunition. These are the people whose actions create things like this, not these people (the order-givers). All they’re doing is speaking into somebody else’s ear. All they’ve done is speech. Speech, not actions. See, again, really look; my actions didn’t cause that. Yes it is. If these people (order-followers) are saying “my actions didn’t cause that,” they’re lying. Very very, very painful and difficult thing for people to comprehend and accept. I’m not telling you “you shouldn’t feel bad hearing this,” but I’m telling you it’s true.

### Part 223
The painful truth: the order-follower always bears more moral culpability than the order-giver for the reason that the order-follower is the one who actually performed the action, and in taking such action, actually brought the resultant harm into physical manifestation. Order-following is the pathway to every form of evil and chaos in our world. It should never be seen as a virtue by anyone who considers themselves as moral human being. Order-followers have ultimately been personally responsible and morally culpable for every form of slavery and every single totalitarian regime that has ever existed upon the face of the earth. That’s the painful truth that people don’t want to accept because they want to believe the absolute nonsense that order-following is a virtue
of any kind. And it needs to be obliterated from the face of the earth because it’s not the way to any kind of virtues or order. It’s the pathway to evil and annihilation, that’s what it is.
