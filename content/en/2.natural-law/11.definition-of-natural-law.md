title: Definition of Natural Law
description: The Immutable, Non-Man-Made Science of Consequences
---

Before we look at the definition of Natural Law, let's look at the definition of the word **_Definition_** - "An exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of a word, concept, or object. Also, the degree of clarity of an object, image, or sound; for example, a high definition television."

::note
To define is to make something (de)finite, as opposed to infinite.
::

The more accurate our definitions for words or concepts are, the better our clarity of meaning, and therefore, our understanding of those words or concepts will be. Therefore, 'Definition' means 'Clarity of meaning' when applying it to words and concepts.

Since most of this guide is going to be about Natural Law from here on out, you must know the
definition of the concept:

## Natural
Inherent, or Having a basis in Nature, reality, and truth. Also, not made or caused by humankind.

## Law
An existing condition which is both binding and immutable (cannot be changed).

## Working Definition

description: Universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behavior for all intelligent beings. Natural Law is a set of universal spiritual laws which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness.</span>

## The Science of Natural Law
Natural Law is a testable hypothesis, meaning it is testable by scientific methodology:

- Question →  
- Gather information →  
- Hypothesis →  
- Observe →  
- Analyze and test data →  
- Draw conclusion →  
- Communicate your results.

::note
Natural Law is not a religion or a belief system, but a science.

let's look at some basic definitions and working definitions. Now, first thing we're going to define is “definition.” Let's define what a definition is.

A definition is an exact statement, a statement of the exact meaning of a word. We're looking for an exact meaning, not a connotation, not a maybe, or a like, or a somewhat, we're looking to narrow the focus, that's why “de-finite's” in it; makes it finite. We're taking it not infinite, we're “finiting” it, we're making it finite. We're actually limiting, through words, what something means so we can be clearer about what we're saying. It's an exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of something. Another way we could look at a definition when we're talking about visual or audio definition is, it's the degree of distinctness or clarity of an object, image, or sound.

So why do people buy HDTV sets? They want higher definition, they want a higher clarity of the picture. If you have high definition audio for audio files, they won't accept anything but high definition audio because in comparison to low-def audio, the clarity of the sound is very good, it's much better. That's what definition is, it is all related to clarity. When we use it in conjunction with words, it means the clarity of the meaning is amplified. When it's with a picture, the clarity of our vision, of ability to see what the picture is, the information in the picture is amplified, and same thing with sound. The more accurate the definitions that we have for words or concepts, the better our clarity of meaning and therefore our understanding of those words or concepts will be. So definition simply means clarity of meaning when we're applying it to words and concepts.

So therefore, let's define Natural Law. This is what we're going to be talking about for the rest of the day, we have to define it. The simple definition of natural is inherent; having a basis in Nature, Reality, and Truth; not made or caused by humankind. so if it's natural, wasn't made by man; mankind didn't make it. And again, the origin of the word, neter in Egyptian means spirit and al means of or related to. So, of or related to spirit; it is all of nature, the spiritual domain. See this is the other part; people believe that the spiritual domain is separate from the physical domain. This is a huge thread and a huge central focus in all of my work. If you think the spiritual domain is not where you are at now because you're in the physical domain, you're mistaken. If you think that the spiritual domain is someplace other than the physical domain, you're also mistaken. If you place emphasis of one above the other and say, “well this one takes precedence and this one's not important,” either way you do it whether you say the spiritual is more important and the world of matter should not be given any significance, it's imbalanced and it's not true. Or if you say, like scientism does, left brain scientism, “the material world is all that there is, this is just a dead mechanized clockwork called the universe and it happened by accident for no reason and there's no such thing as the spiritual domain.”
both of these worldviews, and we're going to get to a breakdown of these worldviews, they're completely inaccurate, they're not based in truth, and most of all, they're based on brain imbalance. And we're gonna see how one of these worldviews or another develops when either the left brain hemisphere or the right brain hemisphere has taken precedence and dominance within the individual consciousness. So Natural means spiritual; these words can be used interchangeably, so when I'm talking about Natural law, I mean Spiritual Law; unseen spiritual laws, but overall, the dictionary definition of natural is it's inherent to nature and it's not made by man. The word law, the definition is; an existing condition, which is both binding and immutable, so let's look at each one of these words. Existing: it means that it is present. It is present, it cannot be just ignored and expected that, oh that doesn't make it true and it's not going to have an effect. It's there, it's present, that's why it's a law that is in operation. It is in operation. It is binding. Binding means that it has an effect. It means it doesn't matter whether you believe it has an effect. It doesn't matter whether you understand that it has an effect, doesn't care. This is another big hammer to the ego. The human ego wants to hear what it wants to hear. One of the things it wants to hear is, the universe cares about you, personally. It cares about John, it cares about Bob, it cares about Mary, it cares about elizabeth, whatever. It cares about you individually as a being. Now you could go so as far as to say you believe that the creator of the universe cares about you, I'm not denying anybody or saying don't think that. What I'm saying is that the laws of the universe don't care about you. Laws have been created in this realm that work flawlessly one hundred percent of the time flawlessly.

let me ask people to envision this scenario to try to clarify this: a couple are on a picnic, they're out in a state forest or something like that. They're on a picnic. About fifty yards away from where they're at, there's a pretty tall cliff, maybe about two hundred feet and it ends in some jagged rocks. They brought their 2-year old child on the picnic with them. They unfold the blanket, take out the picnic basket, they're having their picnic. maybe passions got heated and the husband and wife were making out a little bit. Their kid, two-year-old daughter in her nice Sunday sundress or whatever, wanders off and gets to the edge of that cliff. Will gravity care if the girl goes over the edge? Will gravity allow her to go over the edge? Yes it will. Gravity is not going to say “this girl doesn't understand this law.” And she'll die if she goes over that edge. She's innocent; she's nescient even, not even ignorant. Innocent and nescient, will that law still have an effect? you damn better well believe it will, and so does Natural Law in the same way. Doesn't care whether you don't know, doesn't care whether you're nescient or ignorant, it's in effect, it's binding and it is immutable. Immutable means that nothing you can ever do can ever change it. It is in effect eternally, because man didn't put it into effect.

Know who put it into effect? The creator of the universe put it into effect, and I don't really care what you think of that force as. You could think of it as an impersonal force, You could think of it as the man with a beard, You could think of it as this remote control, I don't really care what you think of it as.

Personally it's none of my business, but you know what? If you think of it as man that makes the laws, then I have a problem because man doesn't make these laws that we're talking about. The creator of the universe set these laws in motion, put them into effect, and they bind you. You and I are bound by these laws whether we like it or not, whether we accept it or not, whether we understand it or not. They're in effect and you are already creating the reality that we're experiencing based upon interaction with these unseen laws. Already, you're already doing it. You can never not be doing it. That's an impossibility. You're always creating, co-creating in cooperation (I should say whether it's in harmony or opposition is a different story) with these spiritual laws that I'm going to be talking about. You are already creating in cooperation with them and can never not do so as long as you exist in the physical domain. That's what the simple definitions that we're working forward with; Natural Law doesn't mean anything other than this, that's it. so let's put the m together: it means inherent existing conditions, conditions that exist in nature which are both binding and immutable. They have an effect whether they're understood or not and they cannot be changed.

so what would be our requirement of knowledge here, what do you think should be done? If we are always working with these, do you think we're going to create something that is wise to create, that is good, that is in alignment with what we say we want if we don't know how these laws operate? You know what's going to be created? a mess, total chaos, something you don't want, something that leads to enormous suffering, which is where we're at. If on the other hand you have that knowledge of how these things work, then you align your behavior to them, you're going to create a whole new different ball game and then you're going to not have self inflicted suffering. That's what this is all about, so let's give a working definition; this is what I call the sound bite. people say, “tell me what Natural Law is Mark.” Uh, you have a few days? Maybe a large portion of the day like we're gonna cover today, maybe some people will get it, but really, you need to devote a large amount of time to studying this, understanding it, reading about it, and even experimenting with it.

this is not an untestable hypothesis, and it's not a hypothesis, this is actually a law, but it's not untestable. You can test it. You can apply all the scientific methodologies to natural Law, same thing: gather your information, observe, hypothesize. (Correcting himself) hypothesize, observe, test the results, publish the results. That's the scientific methodology. The scientific methodology will be born out for everything I'm talking about in this presentation if it is applied, because this is not a religion. This is not some new age mumbo jumbo, this is a science. It is a science that constitutes knowledge of how laws that are existent, in operation, and immutable in this universe work, and how we are creating what we experience in conjunction with these operating laws. And man didn't put them into effect. Whatever created this universe put them into effect.

I'm not here today to tell you what that is. Your job in your own personal experience is to get in touch with what you feel that is. I'm not here to tell you what that is. I'm not here to tell anybody what that is, but my whole point is, it created these laws and they're in effect, and if you want to stop suffering and if you want the human condition to change, you have to understand how these laws work. There is no way around that. Knowledge of these laws is required and this is what people in the so-called new age movement and religious communities and other communities don't want to acknowledge. They don't want to acknowledge that work is required.

So let's give a working definition for Natural Law, my sound bite variant. I tell people who want the six-o-clock news edition of what Natural Law is: Natural Law is universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behavior, and specifically at least on this planet, human behavior. I would say in the universe, it governs the behavior of all intelligent beings. Intelligent beings.

Natural Law is a body of universal spiritual laws, which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness. The governing dynamics of consciousness. That's the working definition.
