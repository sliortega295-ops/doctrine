  title: Truth vs. Perception
  description: Distinguishing Objective Reality from Subjective Experience
---

For some reason, when people hear the term **_Truth_** most tend to immediately jump to incredibly mystified concepts of what truth is (to them); starting to immediately relate the concept to God, or something else that is completely irrelevant. All this is, is mystification and obfuscation of what truth actually is.

Perception is not equal to reality or truth. For example, when a person who is visually  impaired removes their glasses. Reality (truth) will remain the same, while the perception of that individual may drastically change.

description: Truth is objective, meaning it is not based on the perceptions of human beings. This alone can be seen as an assault on the human ego; as everybody likes to think their perceptions are important and accurate.</span>

## Perceptions
People's perceptions can differ slightly from the truth, or they can differ wildly from the truth. The truth does not waver, it does not move, bend, or change; it is that which is. It doesn't matter whether anybody believes it, knows it, sees it, nor if anybody wants to see it. It's there, it has always been there, and it will always be there. Nobody can change what has already happened, the past can impossibly be altered. Unlike the future; and the alteration of the future begins in the present moment.

## Truth
All that truth is, is all that has happened in the past, and that which is happening at the present moment. That which is, and that which has been.

Whenever the term **_Truth_** is used in this guide, that is all that is being referred to.
In the picture shown here, imagine the white lines which do not waver to be truth, and every coloured line to be the perception of an individual. Their ability to perceive what has occurred, and what is occurring, can be referred to as consciousness (a being's ability to
recognize patterns and meaning inside, and around themselves), which can be either accurate, or inaccurate.

In case of a low frequency vibration (red line), the wavelength will be longer, and the wave
won't frequently hit the white line. In case of a high frequency vibration (blue line), the wavelength will be a lot shorter, and the wave hits the white line a lot more frequently.
The higher the frequency of a person's consciousness is, the more their wave of perception
hits the unwavering line of truth.

## Transcript

### Part 34
let’s talk a little bit about the concept of what truth is, how I refer to truth in all of my work because people have a real deeply mystified concept of what truth is or what it means. They’ll get into all these really deep abstract discussions about the mind of god and trying to get into quantum theory and everything. This is mystification of the concept of the truth and we need to demystify it. We have to bring it down to real simple easy to understand language that anybody can comprehend, and then really completely delineate that from perception of any given thing, because the two are not the same. when people say perception is reality, nothing could be farther from reality than that statement. Perception is not reality, it is just what it says, perception, seeing through: per-ceive, to see through something, like a lens or a filter. I perceive things differently without these glasses, that’s one perception. When I put them on, I perceive things quite differently and more clearly. Well that’s how human perception works, like a lens, it’s a filter, but what’s there is the same thing, all that changes is how I perceived it. So let’s look at this concept.


### Part 35
Truth is objective. That means that it’s not dependent upon the perceptions of human beings. No one wants to hear that. That is a direct assault, a direct frontal assault on the human ego, because everybody wants to hear “my perceptions are important.” and we want to also believe “my perceptions are accurate.” Now, people will say, “well, what makes you say your perception of this topic is going to be accurate?” That’s because I went through the process of having to admit over and over and over and over again endlessly how wrong I was about my former perceptions. I went through that destructive process of breaking down my former belief systems, of breaking down my former emotional patterns, but most of all, changing my behavior. That’s the thing that’s the most destructive because we get attached to our behaviors and patterns. So asking people to change, I recognize it’s not easy. It took me like probably about eight years of my life to do it. Most people don’t want to spend a minute on creating personal change, let alone eight years.

When I look at myself, in all honesty, again, none of this is to sound egoic or toot my own horn, but I look at it like I was a mild case of ego entrapment. A mild case compared to where I see other people at. I feel like I was a very brittle stone that just needed to be hit with a chisel a few times and it broke into powder. Other people hardened granite or diamond. To break them down is going to take enormous effort and work. And most of them don’t even want to do it. They’re so calcified. They’ve been so compressed into that hardened state that they don’t even want to start. So, I realize telling people your perceptions are not what really matters; the truth isn’t based upon how you perceive things, that it’s independent from your perceptions, most people don’t want to hear that. They don’t want to hear that. Human beings’ perceptions are capable of wavering. They can waver slightly from the truth and they can waver wildly from the truth. What truth is, is that which does not waver. It doesn’t move, it’s that which is. It doesn’t matter what anybody thinks about it, it doesn’t matter whether anybody believes it, it doesn’t matter whether anybody knows it, it doesn’t matter whether anybody sees it, it doesn’t matter whether anybody wants to see it. It’s there, it’s always been there, it’s always going to be there. Nothing anybody does can change what has happened. Can anybody change what has already occurred in what we call in the thinking of linear time, the past? Not one person here is capable of doing that. Let me tell you something, not one being in the entire manifested universe is capable of doing that because that which has already occurred is set in the record of the universe.

nothing can change the past- ever. Great movie on this, watch the new movie The Time machine. Not the original 50’s or 60’s version, the new one. I think it came out in late 90’s or early 2000’s. This movie got crushed in reviews, crushed. Whenever reviewers crush a movie and give it the worst ratings, go see that film. Because I guarantee you there’s very important allegorical concepts that you need to understand embedded in that film and that’s why reviewers crush it because they don’t want you getting any ideas. this movie got crushed in the theaters and I’m telling you it’s one of the best films to understand the concept of the absolute impossibility of changing the past. The past cannot be altered. You know what can be altered? The future. That’s what that movie is about and you know where the alteration of the future begins? In the present moment, that’s exactly right. That’s the only place it begins.

so what Truth is, the de-mystified concept of Truth is it’s simply that which already exists. It’s that which has happened in the past and is happening in the present moment. the Truth does not exist in the future. When we get to those future moments and it’s the present, Truth will be existent then, but not until. So, there is no such this as truth in the future. Truth is that which has occurred in the past and that which is occurring in the present. It is simply that which is and that which has been. Please, recognize when I use the word Truth, that is all I’m talking about. I’m not talking about the mind of god, I’m not talking about the entire reason for the existence of the universe, I’m talking about the events that have taken place in the past and are taking place in the present. That’s all. and guess what, that’s all the truth is. Doesn’t need to be any more complicated than that. You want to make it more complicated than that, call it something other than truth, so as not to confuse people with what truth really is.

### Part 36
Truth vs. human perception. Now, I want to ask people to imagine, see these white lines? Imagine these white lines that do not waver, as truth, and imagine that the perception that is set against the truth, we’re going to take three individuals: this is individual A, this is individual B, this is individual C (pointing from the bottom to the top). Their ability to perceive what has occurred and what is occurring, is what I would refer to as consciousness. Consciousness is a being’s ability to recognize patterns and meaning with respect to those patterns. Meaning, you have an accurate understanding of what’s taking place within and around you, or you have an inaccurate understanding of what’s taking place in and around you. If your consciousness is high, meaning it’s at a high frequency, that means you’re going to have more of an ability to understand and recognize the patterns. If your consciousness is low, you’re at a low frequency, you’re going to see the pattern less, you’re not going to accurately perceive.

so I liken this to a waveform. In simple physics, a wave, this is a simple sign wave. It has its crest here and its trough here and then the pattern repeats, goes up to the crest down to the trough and repeats over again. The distance between the either crests or troughs of the wave is called the wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the shorter the frequency. What that means is, how frequently is it going to be intercepting the line that represents truth. How frequently is it going to be aligned with this line, which we are calling truth. Can everybody with that level of explanation understand this simple model and what I’m talking about here, is that clear? It’s important because this is a low frequency vibration, it’s a low frequency wave. A wave like this, if it was an audio wave, would produce a low frequency, it would produce a low base tone. As we go up to a higher frequency you can see the wavelength is shorter, meaning that it intercepts the line, which represents truth, much more frequently. We can count them (bottom two waves): one two three four five here, One-nine there. So this is a higher frequency vibration. When we go up to an even higher frequency, let’s say person C has this consciousness, they have a higher frequency and they are intercepting the line that represents truth much more frequently- I won’t count those out because there’s a lot of them. The higher the frequency, the more in tune with truth we are. What would happen if this frequency became infinitely high, what would it become? It would be indistinguishable from a line and therefore someone would be aligned to that which is. the higher the level of consciousness or frequency, which is their perception of reality being accurate, not wavering as much from the truth because it’s hitting it in more places. basically this wave would turn into a line at some point, the higher the frequency went.

Think about this in sound; you hear a low base tone, it’s like “whuuuuwh,” then it goes up, “whoooowh, wheeeewh,” and then it would eventually go outside the range of human hearing because the frequency went so high. Same concept here: the higher the frequency, the higher the perception of reality; the quality of the perception it is going to be. The concept to keep in mind here is perception is not reality; it’s the filter we see reality through. What the human beings’ work is to do, is to align their perception to the reality which exists, which is truth. We need to set aside what we want the truth to be and look at what it is. What it is is altogether different than what we want it to be, but until we recognize what it is, we’re not even in a position to make an accurate diagnosis of what’s going on and therefore create what we want it to be.

### Part 37
So I’m gonna give the first quote here, comes from a gentleman I personally greatly respect. How many people are familiar with Travis Walton by a show of hands? hardly anybody in the room, wow two people, amazing, and I know Barb is in the back because we’ve met him personally. I spoke with this gentleman at a conference last year in 2012 and I just want to say, I just think he’s a totally genuine individual, I don’t care what anybody thinks of me saying that. I believe him. Do I know factually that what he claims happened to him did? No I do not, but I believe what he is saying for a reason. when I’m around somebody, especially for any length of time, I think my intuition is good that I can get a feel for their heart and when he’s telling you stuff it’s very consistent. In his book he asks people, you need to listen to my whole story, suspend your disbelief for a minute and then do your research and then make a judgment call. Do you want to believe me, do you think I’m telling you the truth, do you think I’m lying to you, and then make up your own mind. Who Travis Walton is, is he claims he is an alien abductee that was taken on board an extra-terrestrial craft at a point in his life. He disappeared for days. They were out there looking for him and his best friends were accused of murdering him. And he shows up five days later in deplorable conditions out on a country road some place. Any way, I spoke with him back in 2012, I just bumped into him again we were just a conference; I’m bringing this up for a reason, we were just at a conference in Philadelphia where he spoke and this quote I feel, if I was to quote somebody, I was going to make this the first quote in the presentation today.
travis Walton says in his book, which is called ‘Fire In The Sky’, he said: “I have come to realize that the biggest problem anywhere in the world-the biggest problem in the world, is that people’s perceptions of reality are compulsively filtered through the screening mesh of what they want, and do not want to be true.” Now when I read that in his book, I got chills up and down my spine because I said this meshes exactly with what i’m talking about in my section in my presentation called Truth vs. Perception, and he’s encapsulating it in a sentence perfectly. We want things to be true. That doesn’t make it so. That’s not what makes truth the way that it is. What makes truth the way that it is, is what behaviors were taken and what is the actual effect in the manifested world. That’s how things are. It doesn’t matter how we want them to be, they may be a completely different way right now than we want them to be and I would say for the people in this room, they are a completely different way than we want them to be. But most people in the world think, they kind of believe they’re the arbiter of truth and that‘s a bad place to be in, that’s a very very low level of consciousness to think that if I don’t believe that it’s this way, it’s not this way. Many people are trapped in that state of mind.

Now the reason I even bring this up and included Travis’ quote here is, at this conference that we were just at a couple of weeks ago; I didn’t speak at it, I tabled at it. A woman came up to my table and she picked up my ‘New Age Bullshit’ DVD, which is available here today in the back, and she said what’s this about with a real skeptical look. I explained and I said, “well it’s a seven hour extended video podcast that has many many slides, I gave a shorted version of it at the Free Your Mind conference in Philadelphia, and this is the extended version that goes deeply into the deception of the New Age movement and how it is a religion that is designed to suppress the masculine side of the personality, which is the side that actually takes action and creates change.” And that’s of course pushed by the sacred feminine, which is Care, creativity and compassion. Both need to be present, we’re gonna talk about that here today, but I said, “this is about the suppression of that masculine energy and that’s what the new age movement is about, the suppression of the masculine.” I said “what the new age religion wants to teach people is: just accept everything the way it is no matter how unjust it is, no matter how deplorable the conditions are, no matter how much evil, evil is taking place in our midst, accept it. That’s the new age religion.” And here’s what she said: “that’s exactly how I am. I just accept everything. I don’t make any judgments on anything that occurs, no matter what it is, no matter how it’s perceived. You want to perceive it as evil, that’s your judgement.” I said yes it is my judgement, you know why? Because it’s evil, it really is, there is such a thing. I said, and you’re content to let evil run amuck and take this whole world, because you don’t want to act. Because what’s really there is cowardice, that’s what it really is. She didn’t want to hear that. She said “I prefer not to see it that way.” Now align this with the quote. I prefer not to see it that way. I hope by some miracle, she happens to see this presentation at some point. And in hind sight, I didn’t say this to her on the spot, but I thought about it for a little bit the next day and what I should have really said is “no, you prefer not to see, period.” That’s the truth. So, i prefer not to see it that way means no, I want to ignore reality. I want to believe what I want to be true is the way that it already is. And this is what the new age hoax is peddling to people. So, great quote that I thought accurately sums it all up.
